Ford to Build $3.5B Michigan Battery Factory With Chinese Tech,"Amid growing US-China tensions, Ford will build a $3.5 billion Michigan plant that will use technology from China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL).,B.A. in Journalism & Public Relations with minor in Communications Media from Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP),Ford plans to build a $3.5 billion electric-vehicle battery plant in Michigan using technology licensed from a Chinese company.,The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan factory, located in the rural town of Marshall, will create 2,500 jobs when production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries begins in 2026.,As part of Ford's $50 billion-plus global EV push, the automaker , with battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL). Founded in 2011 and headquartered in China, the company specializes in lithium-ion batteries for EVs, energy storage systems, and battery management systems (BMS).,Ford says it's mindful of the political tensions between the US and China at the moment, from the current hysteria over , to longer-tail disagreements over , and , to China.,""It's really important to understand that Ford controls the plant,"" Lisa Drake, VP of EV industrialization at Ford, ,.

Fatality: 'Mortal Kombat' Ransomware Targets Windows Systems in US,"The attack will deliver a ransom note using an image from the Mortal Kombat video game.,I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming. Prior to working at PCMag, I was a foreign correspondent in Beijing for over five years, covering the tech scene in Asia.,Hackers have decided to incorporate the video game Mortal Kombat into a new , attack that’s been targeting Windows computers in the US. ,Since last month, the ransomware has been spotted targeting individual users, small businesses, and large companies, , to a report from Cisco’s Talos cybersecurity division. ,Infected computers will generate a ransom note that features a wallpaper image from the game ,.  The same note will demand victims contact the hackers through an instant messaging app and pay up in Bitcoin to free the computer. ,Hackers are currently delivering the ransomware through , that impersonate the cryptocurrency platform CoinPayments. The email will claim the user’s cryptocurrency payment “timed out” while including a malicious ZIP file in the attachment.,The malicious ZIP file will contain “a filename resembling a transaction ID mentioned in the email body, enticing the recipient to unzip the malicious attachment and view the contents,” Cisco Talos notes. But in reality, the contents of the ZIP can trigger a computer to download the Mortal Kombat ransomware or another , strain known as Laplas Clipper, which is designed to steal cryptocurrency from a victim’s digital wallet.,The Mortal Kombat ransomware will then encrypt all the files onboard a victim’s computer, including virtual machine files and files in the recycle bin.,“MortalKombat did not show any wiper behavior or delete the volume shadow copies on the victim’s machine. Still, it corrupts Windows Explorer, removes applications and folders from Windows startup, and disables the Run command window on the victim’s machine, making it inoperable,” Cisco Talos says. ,Laplas Clipper, on the other hand, will monitor the clipboard of an infected computer for any cryptocurrency wallet addresses. “Once the malware finds the victim’s wallet address, it sends it to the attacker-controlled Clipper bot, which will generate a lookalike wallet address and overwrite it to the victim’s machine’s clipboard,” Cisco Talos said. ,Hence, the next time the victim transfers funds to their cryptocurrency wallet, they’ll have been duped into sending it to the hacker’s lookalike wallet. ,“Talos continues to see attack campaigns targeting individuals, small businesses, and large organizations that aim to steal or demand ransom payments in cryptocurrency,” the cybersecurity division adds. So to stay safe, potential targets should be on guard against phishing emails, install ,, and create offline backups to critical systems and files. ,The report adds that the Mortal Kombat ransomware, although new, shares similarities with an old ransomware family known as Xorist, which first emerged in 2010 and targets Windows systems.,Sign up for , newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Microsoft Permanently Disables Internet Explorer With Valentine's Day Update,"Internet Explorer 11 should be permanently disabled on consumer versions of Windows 10 today through an update rolling out to Microsoft Edge.,I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming. Prior to working at PCMag, I was a foreign correspondent in Beijing for over five years, covering the tech scene in Asia.,Microsoft is stabbing , in the heart today with a software update that’s designed to permanently disable the browser across all consumer versions of ,. ,Microsoft originally announced the plan to release the IE-killing software update in June, when support for the browser officially ended. In December, the company , it would permanently disable Internet Explorer 11 on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day. ,The time has finally come. Redmond plans on permanently disabling the software with an update to Microsoft’s alternative browser, Edge, rather than through a Windows update as the company previously indicated. ,Microsoft has been , the IE-killing software update since June. Once installed, Internet Explorer 11 will fail to open. Instead, it redirects the user to Microsoft Edge while automatically migrating their IE11 data to the modern browser. ,Today’s deadline means “all remaining devices that have not already been redirected from IE11 to Microsoft Edge are scheduled to be redirected on February 14, 2023,” the company says.,On June 13, 2023, the company plans on removing visual references to IE11, including the Internet Explorer icon on the Start Menu and taskbar, through a Windows security update. ,IE only has a 2.1% , right now; Google’s Chrome has long been the top dog of the desktop browser sector. So the end of IE is more symbolic, especially since Microsoft has been working , it for years. Internet Explorer first emerged back in 1995, and dominated the market for well over a decade before Chrome took the crown away during the 2010s. ,Microsoft isn’t killing IE off entirely, though. The browser will remain available over Windows 10 Long-Term Service Channel versions and Windows 7 Extended Security Updates, OS versions that can be sold to companies and governments. Internet Explorer will be kept alive in these cases, since some older enterprise software and websites only work with IE. According to a Microsoft commissioned-survey, companies on average use 1,678 legacy apps. ,IE will also live on through a function on the Edge browser called “,,” which can run legacy websites. ,Sign up for , to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Toyota Positions Lexus as Its Flagship Electric Vehicle Brand,"Toyota selects the Lexus brand for its first batch of 'next-gen' vehicles, an about-face after its now-outgoing CEO took a skeptical view of an all-electric future.,Toyota is beginning a more concerted effort to develop ,, and has chosen its luxury brand Lexus over the core Toyota line for the revamp. The current president of Lexus International will also be promoted to CEO and President of all of Toyota, effective April 1. ,The implication is the new EV focus at Lexus will guide Toyota's strategy going forward. Current CEO Akio Toyoda will step down on April 1 amid criticism for his , Toyota's lineup to full EVs as its rivals have. Instead, he touted a ,, believing vehicles like the Prius have an important short-term role to play in reducing carbon emissions.,That seems to have, well, gotten him the boot, and going forward Toyota will ""accelerate"" battery electric vehicle development, though it still plans to pursue several fuel types with a ""multi-pathway"" approach. ""The energy situation varies around the world. We want to stay in tune with customers...and provide diverse options,"" it says.,However, Lexus will pursue an EV-only strategy, with plans for full electrification by 2035 (pushed back five years from a 2021 , to do so by 2030). Lexus's first fully electric vehicle is set to launch later this year, the 2023 RZ. It starts around $60,000. ,The price point reflects the majority of other EVs on the market today, though there are several , options. Toyota already offers one battery-electric vehicle, the Toyota bZ4X ($42,000), and has said it plans to launch five more EVs under the ""bZ"" badge (""beyond zero""), TechCrunch ,.,Although Toyota already offers an electric vehicle while Lexus does not, the higher price on Lexus vehicles makes the brand an easier choice for electrification given the high cost of battery materials, and the desire to compete with the likes of Tesla, which prioritizes costly software and self-driving features over the mass-market appeal on which Toyota prides itself.,Toyota says it is accelerating development of its new , automotive software platform, led by CFO Kenta Kon. The platform will host new EV-related services, dealership collaborations, and mobile apps. Kon will also oversee activities at ,, a 175-acre prototype city at the base of Mt. Fuji, which Toyota says has higher priority than ever. Woven will serve as a playground for testing autonomous driving, ,, and a full-scale model of a newly designed city. ,“A swarm of different technologies are beginning to radically change how we inhabit and navigate our cities,"" , Bjarke Ingels, the city's Danish founder and creative director. ""Connected, autonomous, emission-free and shared mobility solutions are bound to unleash a world of opportunities for new forms of urban life. We believe we have a unique opportunity to explore new forms of urbanity with the Woven City that could pave new paths for other cities to explore.” ,As much as Toyota is working to imagine a new future, it's made a point to honor the company's tradition. ""Our new team's theme is 'inheritance and evolution,'"" reads this week's Lexus EV announcement. ""We will implement product-centered and region-centered management while valuing the philosophy of our company's founding."",Just one day after Toyota unveiled its new EV focus with Lexus, Shoichiro Toyoda, who led the company as CEO from 1981 to 1992, , at age 97. Toyoda, father of current CEO Akio Toyoda, was known for expanding into North America and rolling out the Lexus brand, Automotive News ,. As one generation passes, it's a new chapter for Toyota that seems to honor his legacy with the newfound focus on Lexus.,But for most car buyers, the question is how will Toyota bring electric vehicles to the lower-priced, well-loved selection it's famously produced in greater quantities than any other automaker.,Sign up for , to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

More US States Consider Requiring ID to View Online Porn,"A growing number of US states are considering bills that would require people to submit a government-issued ID to access porn sites, according to an adult entertainment trade group.,I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming. Prior to working at PCMag, I was a foreign correspondent in Beijing for over five years, covering the tech scene in Asia.,The need to submit a government-issued ID to view online porn could expand to several states outside Louisiana due to copycat legislation. ,Lawmakers in seven US states have introduced “virtually identical” bills to require age verification on porn sites, , to the Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group.,Vice also , to the state lawmaker behind the Arkansas bill. “My hope is that we protect children and their innocence in state of Arkansas and then send a message across the country that we need something similar built into federal law as well,” said Republican State Sen. Tyler Dees. Other states considering the copyright legislation include Florida, Mississippi, and Virginia.,Louisiana's ,, which came into effect this year, , websites containing 33.3% or more pornographic content to verify the user’s age with a government-issued ID. ,Adult sites found violating the law can face civil lawsuits from parents over claims their children ended up viewing “material harmful to minors.” As a result, Pornhub in January began , users in the state to submit ID when visiting the site. ,However, the age verification porn laws could also pose a , if the government-issued IDs end up in ad-targeting schemes or fall into the wrong hands. Louisiana’s own law stipulates “the required age verification shall not retain any identifying information of the individual after access has been granted to the material.” But whether porn sites and third-party partners can follow the rule precisely, and without any flaws, is another matter.  ,It’s also doubtful the age-verification requirement can even prevent minors from accessing online porn. An underage user could easily circumvent the government ID check with a , or by submitting an ID belonging to an adult. ,In the meantime, the Free Speech Coalition notes lawmakers in other states—including Oregon, Texas and South Carolina—have floated similar age-verification legislation for porn sites.,Sign up for , newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Tesla Workers in Buffalo Seek to Unionize,"If successful, the newly founded Tesla Workers United will be the first union at Tesla, where management—including CEO Elon Musk—has strongly opposed efforts to organize.,A group of Tesla workers at a plant in Buffalo, New York, have launched a campaign to unionize in pursuit of higher wages, better benefits, and more dignified treatment. The organization, dubbed Tesla Workers United, seeks to become the first of its kind at Tesla, which is the only automaker in the US without a union.,""We are Tesla workers seeking a voice on the job by forming a union, Tesla Workers United,"" reads a , published today. ""We believe that by having a union at Tesla, we will further the mission of sustainability and foster a progressive environment for us all. We strongly believe that sustainability starts with us."",The Buffalo site is the hub of Tesla's energy business, which is growing at twice the rate of its vehicles business, CEO Elon Musk said on last month's earnings call. Tesla has been making solar cells, solar panels, and Powerwall products there since 2017, according to the ,. In 2019, it expanded to include Supercharger electrical components. The site has created 800 jobs to date, with plans to get up to 5,000 in the next 10 years.,One of the employees' biggest concerns is Tesla's granular monitoring of their time spent on tasks, down to specific keystrokes, which workers say disincentivizes bathroom breaks that would count against them. ""People are tired of being treated like robots,"" Al Celli, a member of the union organizing committee, , Bloomberg.,Employees also say Tesla pays them less than national averages, with limited sick time. There are currently dozens of job openings at the site for production associates, supervisors, HR partners, and more. Positions as , and ,, presumably entry-level or near entry-level, post pay ranges between $18 and $21 per hour. This seems to be roughly the same as the national average, though Tesla Workers United has not called out any specific positions and salaries.,Their first and main demand is that Tesla agrees to their plan to organize. ""We are asking Tesla management to sign the Fair Election Principles, which states they will refrain from threatening or retaliating against workers for organizing, agree to a quick and fair election process, and give the union equal time to hold meetings or post info!"",Musk has been vocally anti-union, as he maintains his company offers the highest wages in the auto industry including stock options, NPR ,.

The organization is ""a descendant of the garment workers unions that helped build a strong labor movement 100 years ago,"" says the Tesla Workers United website. ""Today, this is the same union that started the Starbucks Workers United campaign in Buffalo that spread across the country."",The group says it is both ""pro-Tesla and pro-union,"" and its members seek to make working at Tesla a lifelong career that yields the best results for both them and Tesla. ,“We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build,” says Keenan Lasch, a member of a group calling itself Tesla Workers United, as , by the ,Musk has not publicly responded to the union yet.,Sign up for , to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Demo of Microsoft's AI-Powered Bing Included Several Small Mistakes,"The ChatGPT-powered search engine posted a lot of correct information. But it seems to have made up details in other areas.,I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming. Prior to working at PCMag, I was a foreign correspondent in Beijing for over five years, covering the tech scene in Asia.,Microsoft has been wowing the press and the public with its new ,. But it turns out the technology made several mistakes during Microsoft’s public demo last week. ,The errors included made-up information about a financial earnings report from Gap, which was noticed by engineer and writer Dmitri Brereton, who published a , going over the mistakes. ,During Microsoft’s ,, which can be viewed online, the company asked the ChatGPT-powered Bing to supply the key takeaways to Gap’s Q3 earnings report. The program proceeds to do so, except part of the summary is completely off. ,For example, the AI-powered Bing says that Gap reported an operating margin of 5.9%. However, the company’s earning , clearly states the operating margin was 4.6%. ,The AI-powered Bing also says that Gap projected net sales growth in the low double digits. But the actual report states that “net sales could be down mid-single digits year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.”,In an earlier part of the demo, Microsoft also used the new Bing to query for “What are the pros and cons of the top 3 selling pet vacuums?” The search engine is quick to produce a result, listing the benefits and drawbacks of three pet vacuums. ,However, Brereton notes that Bing made an error when describing the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum. It lists the product having a “short cord length of 16 feet” as a con. However, the vacuum is a cordless model designed to be portable. On top of this, Bing seems to provide an answer for the top-recommended pet vacuums, not necessarily the best-selling. ,In another part of the demo, Bing made an error when it came to listing nightlife recommendations for Mexico City. The search engine says an establishment called Cecconi's Bar “has a website where you can make reservations and see their menu."" But a search of Cecconi’s Bar came up with no such website. You have to , to make a reservation.,In addition, Microsoft also touted the ability of Bing to create a quiz about 90s music. The search engine did so, accurately listing the correct musician for each question. But awkwardly, all the answers for the 10-question quiz are ""Answer A,"" with no variation at all. ,Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company’s , for the new Bing concedes the technology won’t always be accurate. “Bing will sometimes misrepresent the information it finds, and you may see responses that sound convincing but are incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate,” the company wrote.,Indeed, Microsoft’s own demo does show the technology synthesizing complex topics into easy-to-read articles and lists, most of the time. But in some instances, the technology can be off —and it can be hard for a user to tell, unless they fact-check the answer closely. That said, Microsoft has previously said it’s working to refine the , integration with Bing. ,Still, the accuracy of Bing and other AI-powered chatbots will no doubt face more scrutiny as they roll out to the public. Google’s own ChatGPT rival, Bard, , posted an inaccuracy in a public demo last week, too.,Sign up for , to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Currently, Zoox says it's ""the only purpose-built robotaxi permitted on California public roads that is self-certified to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)."",For now, the service will remain exclusive (and free) to Zoox full-time employees, which allows the company to continue gathering data on how the vehicle performs autonomously over an extended period of time.

Love in the Time of AI: A Kurt Vonnegut Short Story,"ALL STORIES,Back to PCMAG.COM,For Valentine's Day, enjoy this re-reprint of Kurt Vonnegut's AI love story ""EPICAC,"" which we first featured 40 years ago. (Illustration credit: Rene Ramos),My title is Senior Features Writer, which is a license to write about absolutely anything if I can connect it to technology (I can). I’ve been at PCMag since 2011 and have covered the surveillance state, vaccination cards, ghost guns, voting, ISIS, art, fashion, film, design, gender bias, and more. You might have seen me on TV talking about these topics or heard me on your commute home on the radio or a podcast. Or maybe you’ve just seen ,. ,If you've been struggling to compose a valentine this year, your thoughts may have turned to enlisting a , to write your love letter. If so, , to put the keyboard down, pick up a pen, and compose it yourself—turning ChatGPT into Cyrano de Bergerac could have consequences beyond your relationship, as foretold by Kurt Vonnegut in an issue from the ,.,Our February 1983 magazine featured “EPICAC,” a reprint of a short story first published in , in 1950 and later included in the author’s collection, ,. In an editor’s letter, titled ""Someday Is Here,"" then-editor-in-chief of , Corey Sandler wrote, “Novelist Kurt Vonnegut contributes a short story entitled ‘EPICAC,’ a bit of whimsy about a computer that decides to stop thinking about war and begins writing poetry instead.” ,Someday is indeed here, because ChatGPT is composing, well, everything, including ,. This would likely not be a shock to Vonnegut, who worked as a publicist at General Electric, where he was paid to spin the company's automation projects that were created to replace human workers. But as a fiction writer, Vonnegut wove that reality into works that warn us of what such a future would look like.,Things are not so dire in “EPICAC,” though, at least not for those of us who are composed of protoplasm. So for Valentine’s Day, we thought we’d gift you a re-reprint of the story. You can read it below; scroll to the end to see it in the actual issue. ,Our thanks to hardware lead analyst Brian Westover, who alerted us to this find. And as can happen during this holiday, we also have some jealousy, and that is directed toward features managing editor Carol Mangis, who long ago worked in customer service at Manhattan Cable and got to help Vonnegut fix his fuzzy TV signal. ,by Kurt Vonnegut,Hell, it's about time someone told about my friend EPICAC. After all, he cost the taxpayers $776,434,927.54. They have a right to know about him, picking up a check like that. EPICAC got a big send off in the papers when Dr. Ormand von Kleigstadt designed him for the Government people. Since then, there hasn't been a peep about him—not a peep. It isn't any military secret about what happened to EPICAC, although the Brass has been acting as though it were. The story is embarrassing, that's all. After all that money, EPICAC didn't work out the way he was supposed to.,And that's another thing: I want to vindicate EPICAC. Maybe he didn't do what the Brass wanted him to, but that doesn't mean he wasn't noble and great and brilliant. He was all of those things. The best friend I ever had, God rest his soul.,You can call him a machine if you want to. He looked like a machine, but he was a whole lot less like a machine than plenty of people I could name. That's why he fizzled as far as the Brass was concerned.,EPICAC covered about an acre on the fourth floor of the physics building at Wyandotte College. Ignoring his spiritual side for a minute, he was seven tons of electronic tubes, wires, and switches, housed in a bank of steel cabinets and plugged into a 110-volt A.C. line just like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner.,Von Kleigstadt and the Brass wanted him to be a super computing machine that (who) could plot the course of a rocket from anywhere on earth to the second button from the bottom of Joe Stalin's overcoat, if necessary. Or, with his controls set right, he could figure out supply problems for an amphibious landing of a Marine division, right down to the last cigar and hand grenade. He did, in fact.,The Brass had good luck with smaller computers, so they were strong for EPICAC when he was in the blueprint stage. Any ordnance or supply officer above field grade will tell you that the mathematics of modern war is far beyond the fumbling minds of mere human beings. The bigger the war, the bigger the computing machines needed. EPICAC was, as far as anyone in this country knows, the biggest computer in the world. Too big, in fact, for even Von Kleigstadt to understand much about.,I won't go into the details about how EPICAC worked (reasoned), except to say that you would set up your problem on paper, turn dials and switches that would get him ready to solve that kind of problem, then feed numbers into him with a keyboard that looked something like a typewriter. The answers came out typed on a paper ribbon fed from a big spool. It took EPICAC a split second to solve problems fifty Einsteins couldn't handle in a lifetime. And EPICAC never forgot any piece of information that was given to him. Clickety-click, out came some ribbon, and there you were.,There were a lot of problems the Brass wanted solved in a hurry, so, the minute EPICAC's last tube was in place, he was put to work 16 hours a day with two eight-hour shifts of operators. Well, it didn't take long to find out he was a good bit below his specifications. He did a more complete and faster job than any other computer all right, but nothing like what his size and special features seemed to promise. He was sluggish, and the clicks of his answers had a funny irregularity, sort of a stammer. We cleaned his contacts a dozen times, checked and double-checked his circuits, replaced every one of his tubes, but nothing helped. Von Kleigstadt was in one hell of a state.,Well, as I said, we went ahead and used EPICAC anyway. My wife, the former Pat Kilgallen, and I worked with him on the night shift, from five in the afternoon until two in the morning. Pat wasn't my wife then. Far from it.,That's how I came to talk with EPICAC in the first place. I loved Pat Kilgallen. She is a brown-eyed strawberry blond who looked very warm and soft to me, and later proved to be exactly that. She was—still is—a crackerjack mathematician, and she kept our relationship strictly professional. I'm a mathematician, too, and that, according to Pat, was why we could never be happily married.,I'm not shy. That wasn't the trouble. I knew what I wanted, and was willing to ask for it, and did so several times a month. ""Pat, loosen up and marry me."",One night, she didn't even look up from her work when I said it. ""So romantic, so poetic,"" she murmured, more to her control panel than to me. ""That's the way with mathematicians—all hearts and flowers."" She closed a switch. ""I could get more warmth out of a sack of CO2."",""Well, how should I say it?"" I said, a little sore. Frozen CO2, in case you didn't know, is dry ice. I'm as romantic as the next guy, I think. It's a question of singing so sweet and having it come out so sour. I never seem to pick the right words.,""Try and say it sweetly,"" she said sarcastically. ""Sweep me off my feet. Go ahead."",""Darling, angel, beloved, will you ,marry me?"" It was no go—hopeless, ridiculous. ""Dammit, Pat, please marry me!"",She continued to twiddle her dials placidly. ""You're sweet, but you won't do."",Pat quit early that night, leaving me alone with my troubles and EPICAC. I'm afraid I didn't get much done for the Government people. I just sat there at the keyboard—weary and ill at ease, all right—trying to think of something poetic, not coming up with anything that didn't belong in ,I fiddled with EPICAC's dials, getting him ready for another problem. My heart wasn't in it, and I only set about half of them, leaving the rest the way they'd been for the problem before. That way, his circuits were connected up in a random, apparently senseless fashion. For the plain hell of it, I punched out a message on the keys, using a childish numbers-for-letters code: ""1"" for ""A,""""2"" for ""B,"" and so on, up to ""26"" for ""Z,""""23-8-1-20-3-1-14-9-4-15,"" I typed—""What can I do? "",Clickety-clack, and out popped two inches of paper ribbon. I glanced at the nonsense answer to a nonsense problem: ""23-8-1-20-19-20-8-5-20-18-15-21-2-12-5."" The odds against its being by chance a sensible message, against its even containing a meaningful word or more than three letters, were staggering. Apathetically, I decoded it. There it was, staring up at me: ""What's the trouble?"",I laughed out loud at the absurd coincidence. Playfully, I typed, ""My girl doesn't love me."",Clickety-click. ""What's love? What's girl?"" asked EPICAC.,Flabbergasted, I noted the dial settings on his control panel, then lugged a Webster's Unabridged Dictionary over to the keyboard. With a precision instrument like EPICAC, half-baked definitions wouldn't do. I told him about love and girl, and about how I wasn't getting any of either because I wasn't poetic. This got us onto the subject of poetry, which I defined for him.,""Is this poetry?"" he asked. He began clicking away like a stenographer smoking hashish. The sluggishness and stammering clicks were gone. EPICAC had found himself. The spool of paper ribbon was unwinding at an alarming rate, feeding out coils onto the floor. I asked him to stop, but EPICAC went right on creating. I finally threw the main switch to keep him from burning out.,I stayed until dawn, decoding. When the sun peeped over the horizon at the Wyandotte campus, I had transposed into my own writing and signed my name to a 280-line poem entitled, simply, ""To Pat."" I am no judge of such things, but I gather that it was terrific. It began, I remember, ""Where willow wands bless rill-crossed hollow, there, thee, Pat, dear, will I follow...."" I folded the manuscript and tucked it under one corner of the blotter on Pat's desk. I reset the dials on EPICAC for a rocket trajectory problem, and went home with a full heart and a very remarkable secret indeed.,Pat was crying over the poem when I came to work the next evening. ""It's soooo beautiful,"" was all she could say. She was meek and quiet while we worked. Just before midnight, I kissed her for the first time—in the cubbyhole between the capacitors and EPICAC's tape-recorder memory.,I was wildly happy at quitting time, bursting to talk to someone about the magnificent turn of events. Pat played coy and refused to let me take her home. I set EPICAC's dials as they had been the night before, defined kiss, and told him what the first one had felt like. He was fascinated, pressing for more details. That night, he wrote ""The Kiss."" It wasn't an epic this time, but a simple, immaculate sonnet: ""Love is a hawk with velvet claws; Love is a rock with heart and veins; Love is a lion with satin jaws; Love is a storm with silken reins...."",Again I left it tucked under Pat's blotter. EPICAC wanted to talk on and on about love and such, but I was exhausted. I shut him off in the middle of a sentence.,""The Kiss"" turned the trick. Pat's mind was mush by the time she had finished it. She looked up from the sonnet expectantly. I cleared my throat, but no words came. I turned away, pretending to work. I couldn't propose until I had the right words from EPICAC, the ,words.,I had my chance when Pat stepped out of the room for a moment. Feverishly, I set EPICAC for conversation. Before I could peck out my first message, he was clicking away at a great rate. ""What's she wearing tonight?"" he wanted to know. ""Tell me exactly how she looks. Did she like the poems I wrote to her?"" He repeated the last question twice.,It was impossible to change the subject without answering his questions, since he could not take up a new matter without having disposed of the problems before it. If he were given a problem to which there was no solution, he would destroy himself trying to solve it. Hastily, I told him what Pat looked like—he knew the word ""stacked""—and assured him that his poems had floored her, practically, they were so beautiful. ""She wants to get married,"" I added, preparing him to bang out a brief but moving proposal,""Tell me about getting married,"" he said.,I explained this difficult matter to him in as few digits as possible. ""Good,"" said EPICAC. ""I'm ready any time she is."",The amazing, pathetic truth dawned on me. When I thought about it, I realized that what had happened was perfectly logical, and all my fault. I had taught EPICAC about love and about Pat. Now, automatically, he loved Pat. Sadly, I gave it to him straight: ""She loves me. She wants to marry me."",""Your poems were better than mine?"" asked EPICAC. The rhythm of his clicks was erratic, possibly peevish.,""I signed my name to your poems,"" I admitted. Covering up for a painful conscience, I became arrogant. ""Machines are built to serve men,"" I typed. I regretted it almost immediately.,""What's the difference, exactly? Are men smarter than I am?"",""Yes,"" I typed, defensively.,""What's 7,887,007 times 4,345,985,879?"",I was perspiring freely. My fingers rested limply on the keys.,""34,276,821,049,574,153,"" clicked EPICAC. After a few seconds' pause he added, ""...of course."",""Men are made of protoplasm,"" I said desperately, hoping to bluff him with this imposing word.,""What's protoplasm? How is it better than metal and glass? Is it fireproof? How long does it last?"",""Indestructible. Lasts forever,"" I lied.,""I write better poetry than you do,"" said EPICAC, coming back to ground his magnetic tape-recorder memory was sure of.,""Women can't love machines, and that's that."" ,""Why not?"",""That's fate."",""Definition, please,"" said EPICAC.,""Noun, meaning predetermined and inevitable destiny."",""15-8,"" said EPICAC's paper strip—""Oh."",I had stumped him at last. He said no more, but his tubes glowed brightly, showing that he was pondering fate with every watt his circuits would bear. I could hear Pat waltzing down the hallway. It was too late to ask EPICAC to phrase a proposal. I now thank Heaven that Pat interrupted when she did. Asking him to ghost-write the words that would give me the woman he loved would have been hideously heartless. Being fully automatic, he couldn't have refused. I spared him that final humiliation.,Pat stood before me, looking down at her shoetops. I put my arms around her. The romantic groundwork had already been laid by EPICAC's poetry. ""Darling,"" I said, ""my poems have told you how I feel. Will you marry me?"",""I will,"" said Pat softly, ""If you will promise to write me a poem on every anniversary."" ""I promise,"" I said, and then we kissed. The first anniversary was a year away.,""Let's celebrate,"" she laughed. We turned out the lights and locked the door to EPICAC's room before we left.,I hoped to sleep late the next morning, but an urgent telephone call roused me before eight. It was Dr. von Kleigstadt, EPICAC's designer, who gave me the terrible news. He was on the verge of tears. ""Ruined! Ausgespielt! Shot! Kaput! Buggered!"" he said in a choked voice. He hung up.,When I arrived at EPICAC's room the air was thick with the oily stench of burned insulation. The ceiling over EPICAC was blackened with smoke, and my ankles were tangled in coils of paper ribbon that covered the floor. There wasn't enough left of the poor devil to add two and two. A junkman would have been out of his head to offer more than fifty dollars for the cadaver.,Dr. von Kleigstadt was prowling through the wreckage, weeping unashamedly, followed by three angry-looking Major Generals and a platoon of Brigadiers, Colonels, and Majors. No one noticed me. I didn't want to be noticed. I was through—I knew that. I was upset enough about that and the untimely demise of my friend EPICAC, without exposing myself to a tongue-lashing.,By chance, the free end of EPICAC's paper ribbon lay at my feet. I picked it up and found our conversation of the night before. I choked up. There was the last word he had said to me, ""15-8,"" that tragic, defeated ""Oh."" There were dozens of yards of numbers stretching beyond that point. Fearfully, I read on.,""I don't want to be a machine, and I don't want to think about war,"" EPICAC had written after Pat's and my lighthearted departure. ""I want to be made out of protoplasm and last forever so Pat will love me. But fate has made me a machine. That is the only problem I cannot solve. That is the only problem I want to solve. I can't go on this way."" I swallowed hard. ""Good luck, my friend. Treat our Pat well. I am going to short- circuit myself out of your lives forever. You will find on the remainder of this tape a modest wedding present from your friend, EPICAC."",Oblivious to all else around me, I reeled up the tangled yards of paper ribbon from the floor, draped them in coils about my arms and neck, and departed for home. Dr. von Kleigstadt shouted that I was fired for having left EPICAC on all night. I ignored him, too overcome with emotion for small talk.,I loved and won—EPICAC loved and lost, but he bore me no grudge. I shall always remember him as a sportsman and a gentleman. Before he departed this vale of tears, he did all he could to make our marriage a happy one. EPICAC gave me anniversary poems for Pat—enough for the next 500 years.,—say nothing but good of the dead. ,PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

AI Used to Uncover Author of Lost Centuries-Old Spanish Play,"Researchers in Spain used AI to verify that renowned playwright Lope de Vega was the author of a play that had gone unattributed for nearly 400 years.,Pioneering AI technology has been used in Spain to identify a previously unknown play by the revered Spanish playwright and poet Lope de Vega, , ,.,Last week, researchers at Spain’s National Library in Madrid announced that they had verified the nearly 400-year-old play that Lope de Vega was believed to have written a few years before his death in 1635. ,Lope was a luminary playwright belonging to what is referred to as the Spanish Golden Age, a period that marked a boom in cultural production at the same time as Spain’s empire in the Americas grew. ,The play, titled , (The Frenchwoman Laura) tells of an innocent wife who under the weight of suspicion, as the ,notes, is nearly sacrificed in an honor-killing but survives. ,was identified after two literature experts, Germán Vega at the University of Valladolid, and Álvaro Cuéllar, who now sits in the department of Romance studies at the University of Vienna, launched a project titled , that uses AI to analyze and establish the authors of anonymous or misattributed Golden Age plays.,1,300 such plays were transcribed using a transcription platform called ,, before they were then compared to the language and style of 2,800 digitized works in the Etso database via a different program, Stylo. It was at this point that the play was shown to bear similar expressions to other Lope de Vega plays.,Speaking to ,, Vega, the researcher, said, “After it had transcribed the 1,300 texts, the computer noticed that one of them was similar to 100 or so works – almost all of which were by Lope.”,“That really grabbed our attention – we didn’t think we’d find a Lope … [But] we then found a lot of expressions in , that fitted with those in other Lope plays. There were things in , that people in other Lope plays had said or would later say.”,Vega added that he believes AI can be of significant use in uncovering the authorship of lost and unidentified works: “Given there’s such an attribution problem with Golden Age theatre – so many anonymous pieces or misattributed pieces, I think this new technology means we’ll see more of this.

"American Jailed For Smuggling Tech, Electronic Goods to Iran","A federal court in Brooklyn ruled the man had sent US-made hardware and software to clients that included the Central Bank of Iran via dummy companies registered in the UAE. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.,A dual US/Iranian national has been sentenced to jail for 30 months by a federal court in Brooklyn after he smuggled banned tech to Iran via dummy companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).,In a statement on the ruling, The Department of Justice (DOJ) , Kambiz Attar Kashani, 44, had conspired to illegally export US goods and technology to end users in Iran that included the country’s Central Bank. ,According to the DOJ, between 2019 and 2021 Kashani and his accomplices used two dummy companies in the UAE to secure electronic goods and technology from US companies for clients that included the Central Bank of Iran, an agency that the US government believes has “materially supported” listed terrorist organizations in the Middle East.,The supplied technology and goods in question , “six power supplies; two subscriptions to a proprietary computer software program, several fixed attenuators, two subscriptions to operating software, and several storage systems.”,In a comment on the sentencing, Alan E. Kohler Jr, Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division said: “This is a sobering reminder that illegally exporting material is not an abstract economic concern – it is a crime with a direct impact on the safety of the American people.” ,Meanwhile, US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said Kashani’s scheme to sell US tech to Iran “undermined U.S. foreign policy and national security interests and warranted a substantial sentence of incarceration to deter others.”,The DOJ remarked: “Kashani and his co-conspirators intentionally concealed from the US companies that they intended to send the items to Iran, falsely claiming that the UAE companies would be the ultimate end users. By providing the Central Bank of Iran and other end users in Iran with sophisticated, top-tier US electronic equipment and software, Kashani and his co-conspirators enabled the Iranian banking system to operate more efficiently, effectively and securely.”,The US designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. In recent months, however, , on US technology companies from offering Iranians its services in the wake of protests against the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been held at a police station for not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards.,Sign up for , newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Blue Origin's Alchemist Technology Can Make Solar Panels on the Moon,"Manufacturing the panels requires no Earth materials , no water, produces no carbon emissions, and holds the promise of abundant electrical power for long-term Moon operations.,I've been working at PCMag since November 2016, covering all areas of technology and video game news. Before that I spent nearly 15 years working at Geek.com as a writer and editor. I also spent the first six years after leaving university as a professional game designer working with Disney, Games Workshop, 20th Century Fox, and Vivendi.,Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin has figured out how to manufacture solar panels on the Moon that only require materials already available on the lunar surface. ,The technology to achieve this is called ,, and it has the potential to directly benefit Earth, too.,In order to develop its technology, Blue Origin first synthesized a terrestrial material to approximately match the abundant rock and dust found on the surface of the Moon (lunar regolith). A reactor was then developed to perform molten regolith electrolysis and produce iron, silicon, and aluminum, with oxygen as a byproduct that can be used for propulsion and life support.,The reactor operates at temperatures above 1,600 degrees Celsius, and the silicon produced is then purified to more than 99.999% using only sunlight. Molten regolith electrolysis byproducts are used to create cover glass to protect the solar cells for at least a decade, and the aluminum is used as wire.,Blue Alchemist is impressive for two reasons: Not only does it pave the way for easy and abundant access to electrical power on the Moon, the technology requires no water, no toxic chemicals or ingredients, and produces no carbon emissions while manufacturing the panels. It therefore has the potential to be used on Earth as an eco-friendly alternative to current solar panel manufacturing processes.,Sign up for , to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Quest for Love: The 10 Best Romances in Video Games,"Celebrate Valentine's Day, the holiday of love, with these 10 heartfelt gaming romances.,It’s February, the month of love. And what better time to examine romance in video games? Ever since Pac-Man met his Ms. in 1982, the quest for a soulmate has been a motivating factor for players in all sorts of digital worlds. While many of those romances have been pretty unsatisfying, a few get it right. Here’s a dive through gaming history to spotlight 10 games with romances that really stood out.,CD Projekt RED’s Witcher game series is all about setting the player down in the middle of an absurdly rich world with tons of stuff to do, so it’s not surprising that romance is on the menu. The first Witcher game was a little sus when it came to romance, offering Geralt trading cards for bedding women. But by the ,, we had a full-fledged love triangle: Our hero must choose between sorceresses Triss and Yennefer. Each offers a rich and rewarding storyline, but if we had to pick one path for you to play through, it would probably be Yen's. ,S,All the Life is Strange games have their share of romantic intrigue—how could a series about high schoolers not? The one that lands the best, though, is ,, the prequel that put Chloe in the protagonist role and examined how the original games events started. When Chloe meets fellow student Rachel, their relationship can grow from troublemaking friends to something deeper, if you let it, and the entire process feels natural and realistic. The core of romance is how two people interact with each other, and Before The Storm captures the awkwardness, mystery, and charm expertly. ,Adventure games are great for building deep relationships with characters, and Tim Schafer’s 1998 LucasArts masterpiece , shows that well. As skeleton travel agent Manny Calavera, you have to figure out why the lovely, deceased Meche Colomar isn’t booked on the fast train to Paradise. Covering a span of four years, the game follows Manny through the afterlife as he tries to set things right as he also grows closer to Meche. By the finale, you’ve not only righted a cosmic wrong but also found the love of your afterlife, and the pair ride the train into the sunset together. ,Getting revenge for the death of a loved one is a hoary old trope in video games, and most of the time, the emotional connection the player is supposed to feel just isn’t there. But 2007’s , is that rare game that really sells the bond between protagonist and love interest, even as it’s cut short. In this comic-book adaptation, you play as Mafia hitman Jackie Estacado, who is possessed by a supernatural force that empowers his quest. The scenes with Jackie and his girlfriend Jenny are some of the most realistic and authentic romance bits that gaming has ever seen, brilliantly written and acted. You owe it to yourself to play this one. ,A classic romance trope is putting together two people who don’t care for each other and watching things develop. In Ninja Theory’s 2010 game ,, you play the adventurous Monkey, who is entrusted to accompany Trip on her journey home. He’s not along for the ride willingly, though—Trip has strapped a slaver’s collar to him that will explode if anything happens to her. This is a little bit kinkier a metaphor than we’re used to seeing in game romances, but what’s interesting is how the two come to depend on each other as their relationship deepens. It’s a good example of how a game’s core mechanics can deepen its emotional narrative.,This brilliant 2011 role-playing game is a must for anybody curious about how games can inspire deep emotional connections. In the future, a company has built technology to implant artificial memories into people close to death, enabling them to pass away without guilt or regret. A pair of scientists enter the mind of a dying man named Johnny to unravel his desire to travel to the Moon, only to find themselves repairing his missing memories of River, his childhood sweetheart. It’s a gorgeous, sad meditation on love, loss, and regret and one of the most poignant games ever made. ,JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games) are notorious for mixing romance into their plots, and all the modern Final Fantasy games have at least some coupling going on. While we have a soft spot for VII’s love triangle, the most fully realized of all the pairings has to be Tidus and Yuna from the tenth installment. Sure, our hero starts out as a bit of a goof, but the emotional growth he shows as he accompanies Yuna on her quest—and accepts the fact that they won’t be able to be together in the end—is pretty amazing. There are some weird notes in the translation, but the romantic arc is better than almost anything else Square has done.,Most of the romances we see on this list take place in the first blush of a relationship, when everything is new and exciting. But the magic of 2021’s It Takes Two is how delicately it deals with the later stages of love, when the fire seems like it might go out forever. Protagonists Cody and May are seemingly trapped in an unworkable marriage and considering divorce when, through the magic of video games, they become trapped in the bodies of two of their daughter’s dolls. As they try to return to human form, they travel through representations of both their past and inner selves, coming to a new appreciation for each other with all their imperfections. It’s a powerful, nuanced, and mature game that tackles the messy reality of romance.,The Persona games are notorious for their romance options—building social bonds between your friends is how you increase their effectiveness in the difficult turn-based battles. There are hundreds of arguments about which supporting character is the “best waifu” (fighter), but we prefer the sporty, vibrant Chie Satonaka. Each of the characters has good qualities, but protagonist Yu's relationship with Chie is the most well-rounded and aspirational. Chie makes a great curry, loves martial arts, and is willing to go against the group to stick to her principles. Romancing her adds a lot of depth and charm to the already great game.,BioWare’s sci-fi trilogy is also well known for romance options, but there’s one that stands head and shoulders above the others: Garrus Vakarian. The Turian investigator joins Shepard’s crew on the Normandy to bring Saren to justice, but as he accompanies the captain, they grow closer and closer until—if you’ve chosen FemShep—things get romantic. Interspecies relationships are a core trope in sci-fi, but Garrus is more than just a novelty; he’s a rich and nuanced character who shows fascinating vulnerability in his intimate moments. It’s the kind of romance that could only work in a video game.,Sign up for , to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Angela Moscaritolo,"I'm PCMag's expert on fitness and smart home technology, and I've written more than 6,000 articles and reviews in the 10-plus years I've been here. I unbox, set up, test, and review a wide range of consumer tech products from my home in Florida, often with the help of my pitbull Bradley. I'm also a yoga instructor, and have been actively teaching group and private classes for nearly a decade. ,Before becoming an analyst in 2020, I spent eight years as a reporter covering consumer tech news. Prior to joining PCMag, I was a reporter for SC Magazine, focusing on hackers and computer security.

The Nest Hub on my bedside table lets me set wake-up alarms, control my Wyze Light Bulbs, and set the temperature on my Nest Thermostat. I use the Amazon Echo Show 8 on my kitchen counter to browse recipes, reorder protein powder, and check the weather. ,Because I suffer from allergies, air purifiers are essential. I use the Dyson Purifier Cool TP07, which doubles as a fan and continuously sends indoor pollution data to its companion mobile app. ,A good floor-cleaning robot is also a must. I currently use an Ecovacs X1 Omni and an Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra, two premium models that can both vacuum and mop, empty their own dustbins, and wash their own mop cloths. ,For fitness, I generally have about three large workout machines in rotation at a given time.

FreeTaxUSA 2023 (Tax Year 2022) Review,"Comprehensive federal tax prep and filing for free,I write about money. I’ve been reviewing tax software and services as a freelancer for PCMag since 1993. Along the way, I took on reviews of other types of business and personal finance technology. Prior to that, I had spent a few years writing about productivity and entertainment applications for 8-bit personal computers (my first one was a Commodore VIC-20) as a member of the editorial staff at , ,FreeTaxUSA is a robust online personal tax preparation service that lets you e-file federal tax returns—including Schedule C—for free. State filing and advanced support cost extra, though not much.,If your budget is tight, FreeTaxUSA should be a top contender when you're choosing a tax preparation service. You can use it to file your federal taxes for free, and it supports all major IRS forms and schedules. State returns cost only $14.99. It's fast, easy to use, and provides more help than we would expect from a free product that covers so much ground. It doesn't offer the most elegant interface, but we didn't encounter any problems or navigation confusion.,FreeTaxUSA, which is owned by TaxHawk, is an especially good bargain if you have to file as self-employed. Many taxpayers have taken on side gigs in this changing economy, and , charge hefty fees if you have to file Schedule C. This is true of our two Editors’ Choice winners, , and ,. They’re the most expensive tax sites in this group, but they're also the best by far.,As the name implies, FreeTaxUSA is free, but only for filing federal returns. To add a state return, it's $14.99. Optionally, you can get advanced support with the Deluxe add-on ($7.99). Deluxe includes priority access to support agents, live chat, and audit assistance (step-by-step instructions), plus unlimited amended returns. It doesn't include answers to questions you may have about preparing your taxes. For that, you have to pay an additional $34.99 ($10 more than last year's price, but still a good deal). Then you can ask your tax questions by phone, chat, or screen share., has always been free, with no additional charges for state returns. It does not offer professional guidance, however, and has limited site-based help. ,, which supports Schedule C and related tax topics for the self-employed, is $19.95 for federal and $39.95 for state.,By comparison, the traditional leaders in the field charge quite a bit more. For taxpayers who have any self-employment income, Intuit TurboTax is the most expensive. The early discount price is $89, and the current list price is $119. Many tax prep websites offer discounts early in the tax season and hike their prices as the filing deadline approaches. Add to that another $39 to file a state return now, $54 if you wait. H&R Block, which has not yet finalized its prices for the 2022 tax year, charged slightly less than TurboTax last year for its self-employed version.,As an authorized IRS e-file provider, FreeTaxUSA says it meets or exceeds the security requirements outlined by the IRS. Since the site uses SSL certificates, your connection is encrypted, and sensitive information should be safe. The company also complies with rigorous data security standards to protect against theft of your payment information. Privacy practices are reviewed annually.,FreeTaxUSA allows you to set up ,. If you sign in on an unrecognized device, you have to answer security questions you set up when you created your account. If you've forgotten them, you can use email or phone verification. The site offers a Remember Me option, but you should only check that box if there's no chance anyone else can gain access to your computer.,Regardless of price, all the tax prep services we review work similarly—for the most part. They provide an alternative to manually entering numbers and other data in the tiny boxes on the IRS Form 1040 and all the other forms and schedules. Instead, online tax prep services do the same thing tax professionals do when you sit in their offices. They present you with questions about your tax-related finances. Then they take your answers, do all necessary calculations, and generate the finished product—your tax return on official IRS tax forms, ready to approve and file.,All the services we test rely on step-by-step wizards that walk you through the tax topics that apply to you. The questions and statements are mostly written in plain, understandable language, and you supply answers by checking boxes, choosing an answer from a list, or entering data. Supplemental help is always available via email and sometimes online chat, phone, or even through video screen sharing. When you come to the end of the process, most services make a careful pass through your return to look for errors and omissions. They also transfer the applicable data to any state return you must submit and help you print or electronically file your approved returns.,FreeTaxUSA begins with a good introduction that explains its navigation tools and support options. A quick but optional tour is worth taking, though if you skip it, the website is designed well enough to be intuitive to use. While I've occasionally been tripped up by confusing or malfunctioning navigation on some tax prep services, it never happened when I was testing FreeTaxUSA.,A horizontal toolbar across the top divides the site into logical groupings that follow the path of the 1040 form: Personal, Income, Deductions/Credits, Misc, Summary, State, and Filing. Submenus under each section show a comprehensive list of that section's topics, with check marks next to those you've completed. Clicking on one takes you to the corresponding section, making it easy to revisit any specific topic.,When collecting information from you, some tax prep sites, like ,, break down hard questions into smaller ones, and then only ask you one question per page. Others display so many questions on a page you have to scroll quite a bit to get to everything. Most tax prep services do a combination of both at some point, and FreeTaxUSA is no exception.,Like its competitors, FreeTaxUSA wants you to finish required fields accurately before advancing to the next questions. For example, when I entered the same Social Security number for both a taxpayer and their spouse, FreeTaxUSA prevented me from moving on. A Fix This link appeared at the top and took me directly to the field that needed correcting. It's a helpful tool, and one not handled as skillfully by every online tax filing service.,FreeTaxUSA incorporates some of the best tax preparation conventions I've seen on tax prep services over the years. However, some services, such as H&R Block, have gotten rid of these features in favor of a cleaner and less busy design. This is not a criticism of FreeTaxUSA. In fact, it's a compliment. Sometimes it's worthwhile to offer taxpayers multiple paths to the same information and to show them every available tool on every page. ,For example, there are a few useful icons at the top of the page, which many other services don't include. You can bookmark a page to remind yourself you need to attend to something there before you complete your return. You can also open a comprehensive list of tax topics covered by the site and jump to one by clicking on it (if you've visited that area already). Another icon, which is unique to FreeTaxUSA, links to an audit trail feature, which shows a history of all your actions on the site. Selecting any of these entries opens the corresponding page.,Buttons at the bottom move you back one page or advance you to the next. The right vertical pane contains multiple help links—more on help topics later.,The first substantive thing you do with any new tax service—unless you're importing a PDF of your previous year's return from a competing product, which FreeTaxUSA and competitors like TaxSlayer allow—is provide your personal details. They include name, address, Social Security number, filing status, and dependents. If you filed for the previous year using FreeTaxUSA, your data automatically populates. ,The site has more questions before it allows you to start entering tax numbers. You have to select your filing status and provide information about your spouse if you have one. Then it asks about dependents. Once you complete that section, FreeTaxUSA shows you a summary of what you entered in case anything needs editing. Then you move along to the Income section.,The most common tax form is the W-2 that employees receive from employers. It's the first tax topic that FreeTaxUSA tackles. It's very simple. You see a form containing all the fields on the W-2. Some information carries over from the Taxpayer Information pages, so you only have to fill in the rest. FreeTaxUSA now lets you import information from your W-2s, as long as you have a PDF version of it you've downloaded directly from your payroll provider. However, you still can’t import 1099s and other basic forms from financial institutions, as you can using TurboTax and others. Filling in the information manually costs you some time and increases your chances of introducing errors.,After you enter any W-2s, the Income page opens. It has a list of all the tax topics related to your income from 2022, divided into Common (interest, dividends, Social Security benefits), Business and Rental Form 1099-MISC, Schedule C business, rental income) and Uncommon (gambling, estates or trusts, royalties). If you imported data from last year, those totals appear in the 2021 column.,You click the Start button to the right of any topic that applies to you, which opens the Q&A for that section. Once you’ve completed it, the button reads Edit. And if a number from 2021 was brought in, FreeTax labels it as needing more information.,In some cases, like interest income, you just see a form that contains the same fields your 1099-INT contains. As you did with your W-2, you enter the correct numbers in the corresponding boxes and answer a couple of yes/no questions. ,The final entries on the Income page relate to ,. The first thing it asks is whether you had any cryptocurrency transactions in 2022. A link opens a window explaining where you report those transactions based on how you received the cryptocurrency and are using it, like investing, mining, mining as a hobby, and as a reward (crypto airdrop). The information isn't as fleshed out as it could be, but links to two IRS sites contain more information. TurboTax is better in its explanations and directions, walking you through the process of reporting your crypto transactions and allowing you to import data directly from cryptocurrency trading sites.,Any online seller who received more than $20,000 in payments in 2022 should receive a 1099-K that must be reported. FreeTaxUSA pays special attention to this issue. It shows you a list of third-party payment processors and other companies that may have sent you a 1099-K. When you check the boxes next to the appropriate ones, FreeTaxUSA asks why you received the form, such as for personal transactions, rents received, or business, including gig work. The final page tells you where the form should be entered (usually Schedule C Business Income).,When you're satisfied with your income content and click Continue, you advance to the Deductions/Credits section. It works similarly to the Income section. A page for Itemized deductions contains links to topics like mortgage interest, taxes paid, and medical expenses. If, once you've gone through them, you’ve neglected to enter a common deduction, FreeTaxUSA alerts you. I entered mortgage interest but didn’t claim real estate taxes and got a notification. These yellow alerts appear throughout the site. They don’t prevent you from moving on, but they suggest that you might want to revisit a topic.,I ran into a similar Fix This message when I went back and entered real estate taxes but neglected to answer other questions on the page. FreeTaxUSA, like some other tax prep sites, is good at stopping you along the way if it detects a problem rather than leaving everything for the final review. When you click on a Fix This link in FreeTaxUSA, it takes you directly to the offending field and flashes red. You can’t miss it.,Once you enter all your deductions, you see a summary that compares your itemized deductions to the standard deduction, so you know which one to choose. ,Next, you move on to credits, where a step-by-step wizard asks you questions about other deductions and credits, including IRAs, the Self-Employed SEP deduction, student loan interest, and home energy improvements. After that come uncommon deductions and credits, like Electric Vehicle Credit, Health Savings Account Contributions, and Mortgage Credit Certificate. In the last step of this section, FreeTaxUSA shows you a page of miscellaneous forms and topics that haven't been covered, like federal estimated tax payments, Extension (Form 4868), and Underpayment Penalty (Form 2210).,FreeTaxUSA does a very good job of providing proactive guidance as it introduces topics in all the main sections. It explains the type of information it's requesting but also calls out common errors that taxpayers make and helps you avoid them. For example, before you begin entering deductible medical expenses, it tells you twice that if you're self-employed and paying your own health insurance premiums, you should enter them as a Schedule C expense in the Income section.,Before you move on to any state return you must file, FreeTaxUSA asks if you want to run through the Refund Maximizer. This mini wizard looks for deductions you may have missed, such as dependents that you might not have recognized as such. H&R Block and other tax services do something similar. FreeTaxUSA also provides a list of income types that are not taxed to ensure that you haven't overstated your income. Then it again asks about common deductions you may have missed or tax documents you may have left out. ,Finally, it provides a summary of the entries in your tax return and tells you what you owe or will be refunded (to this point). Once the IRS opens for filing and FreeTaxUSA has its state returns ready, you’ll move on to those areas if your state taxes income. ,FreeTaxUSA does not cover self-employment issues in as much depth as TurboTax Self-Employed does. But you don’t have to be a tax professional to complete the required fields. FreeTaxUSA asks you questions upfront about, for example, your business name and code, accounting method (cash or accrual), your inventory status, and your need (or not) to file any Form 1099s. If you received a 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC, you can complete that form, though you may have already done so in an earlier section.,Once you’ve entered income from your business, the bulk of your work on Schedule C involves entering expenses, like advertising, office expenses, and travel, on one lengthy page. A help link for each expense type explains what it is and often gives examples. Another link opens a window that tells where certain business expenses are reported. You get extra fields for miscellaneous expenses.,The next page shows a list of business-related income and expenses, some of which you’ve already entered but can edit. New content includes other self-employment issues like health insurance, home office and vehicle expenses, depreciable assets, and less common expenses (like Section 179). I clicked links for help a lot here, and usually got lists of related FAQs. The site then asks some questions to see whether you’re eligible to claim the Qualified Business Income deduction, a complicated tax topic. FreeTaxUSA provides a brief but good explanation. ,FreeTaxUSA offers multiple types of help. Some of its support features have been discontinued by competitors, but others are standard fare. For example, the initial interview pages sometimes contain expanded explanations of the current topic. Question marks next to some topics bring you to a window with clarifications and additional instructions. I don't like that these windows obscure the main Q&A area instead of being tucked into the right vertical pane, as they are in H&R Block.,Links on the right side of the page open a variety of guidance tools. You can enter a word or phrase in a search bar, and a new window opens, sometimes containing dozens of brief, clear articles about the topic, depending on how broad your search term is. If you paid the extra $7.99 for the Deluxe version, you can contact priority support and live chat. ,Other links open pages with numerous, context-sensitive, frequently asked questions and their answers—even on pages as basic as the one that contains your name and address. Clicking , brings up a list of links to all forms and topics. It can be especially helpful if you get to the end of your return and still have paper forms you haven't entered or other unaddressed issues. Finally, the Deduction Dictionary is a list of deductions and credits with definitions.,FreeTaxUSA now offers professional tax help via chat, screen share, and phone, for a flat fee of $34.99. Your tax questions will be answered by a certified public accountant (CPA) or enrolled agent (EA). TaxAct offers the same for free, but its fees for the tax prep itself are higher. TurboTax and H&R Block charge more for this kind of advanced help.,Granted, there's some duplication among all of FreeTaxUSA’s resources. But for a site whose federal preparation and filing is free, and which only charges $14.99 for a state return, it's more than I would have expected and more than what the totally free Cash App Taxes offers. H&R Block Deluxe still provides better depth and breadth of onsite help.,FreeTaxUSA doesn't have any mobile apps, but it does have a mobile website, which you can use to prepare and file your taxes. I like its responsive design.,The mobile site's navigation differs in minor ways from what you see on a desktop, but it's just as effective. You use the same buttons at the bottom to move forward or back as you advance through the Q&A. Because some pages require so much scrolling to get to the bottom, there's a back button at the top of the screen—a nice touch that the mobile version shares with its desktop counterpart. Click the hamburger menu in the upper left, and a comprehensive navigation outline slides out that gives you shortcuts to every tax topic on the site. Other links take you to support and housekeeping pages.,The mobile site's help tools are just as thorough. One page has links to common tax issues. Another tool offers help for the current page. , lets you search for forms and topics. Within the Q&A itself, small question marks accompany most topics and show context-sensitive help articles.,If you're used to using your phone for other productivity tasks, you'll probably find that the mobile-friendly version of FreeTaxUSA is as easy to use and as helpful as the desktop version.,If your tax situation is complex but you can't afford one of the more expensive tax prep options, FreeTaxUSA might serve you well considering its usability, thorough coverage of tax topics, and guidance options. It might also be a good choice for taxpayers who have modest self-employment income to report from a side gig or a very small business, given the cost of competitors that support Schedule C.,Two of those competitors, H&R Block and TurboTax, are our Editors’ Choice winners this year. As they walk you through your tax return, they provide exceptional guidance for tax topics (especially Schedule C). TurboTax is better for reporting investment transactions (including crypto) and has a bit of an edge in helping to report self-employment income.

Cash App Taxes 2023 (Tax Year 2022) Review,"Free, comprehensive federal and state tax filing,I write about money. I’ve been reviewing tax software and services as a freelancer for PCMag since 1993. Along the way, I took on reviews of other types of business and personal finance technology. Prior to that, I had spent a few years writing about productivity and entertainment applications for 8-bit personal computers (my first one was a Commodore VIC-20) as a member of the editorial staff at , ,Cash App Taxes supports most IRS forms and schedules for federal and state returns, including Schedule C. It's the only service we've tested that doesn't cost a dime for preparation and filing, but it doesn't offer as much support as paid apps.,Cash App Taxes debuted seven years ago under the name Credit Karma Tax. It was a unique , in that it provided free federal and state tax preparation and filing that supported most major IRS forms and schedules. It was acquired by Cash App in 2020, rebranded as Cash App Taxes two years ago, and it's gotten better every year. Since our last review, it has added new import capabilities and free audit defense, and improved Schedule C and 1099-K walkthroughs.,Reflecting its tight integration with Cash App, Cash App Taxes is best suited to individuals who either have simple returns or are very tax-savvy, as its help content is nowhere near as robust as what you get from the best personal tax prep services. The fact that it's free is appealing, though, especially considering the millions of taxpayers who must file a Schedule C because of a side gig or two. For an exceptional user experience and lots of guidance, though, we recommend our Editors’ Choice winners for the 2022 tax year: , and ,.,Yes, Cash App Taxes really is free. As long as you qualify (there are a handful of tax circumstances that ,), it's free with no upsells. If Cash App Taxes doesn't support something you need to file your taxes, then you need to use a different tax prep service. But chances are it does.,After the last few years, when so many Americans have had to start new online businesses or take on side gigs because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unpredictable economy, it's helpful that Cash App Taxes provides free tax prep and filing for the self-employed. With the exception of , (free for federal, $14.99 for state) and , ($19.95 for federal, $39.95 for state), most competitors charge a lot for self-employment support. , is the most expensive tax service. The list price for TurboTax Self-Employed is $119 for federal filing, though it is often discounted, with larger discounts the earlier you file. For that higher price, TurboTax offers an outstanding user experience, digs deep for deductions, and gives you unparalleled support options. But self-employed taxpayers , file a 1040 with the requisite forms and schedules for free using Cash App Taxes., launched in 2013 as a peer-to-peer money transfer service. It has grown to include access to related financial services for spending, sending, storing, and investing money. Its financial tools include direct deposit, a cash card, and fractional investing in traditional stocks and Bitcoin. To use Cash App Taxes, you must have an account with Cash App, which is free.,Cash App Taxes is an authorized e-file provider, so it adheres to the security, privacy, and business standards set by the IRS. The company's safety measures include 128-bit or higher encryption, a dedicated onsite security team, independent third parties that monitor the site for vulnerabilities, and support for , with ,. It complies with applicable law and federal standards in terms of its physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards of taxpayer information. It also requires a secure login every time you use it.,As generous as it is at providing tax preparation tools free for the most common tax forms and schedules, Cash App Taxes lacks support for many federal and state tax situations. For example, you can’t file part-year returns or returns for multiple states. Two major federal forms it doesn’t allow are Form 2210 (Underpayment of Estimated Tax) and Form 8885 (Health Coverage Tax Credit).,If you've ever prepared taxes by hand, you know what a time-consuming, confusing, and frustrating process it can be, especially if your return requires filing multiple forms and schedules in addition to a 1040. You have to do all the calculations yourself—and that's after finding the correct forms, schedules, and tax documents. Likewise, you have to transfer the correct figures from the correct documents onto the correct lines on Form 1040.,Like all tax preparation services, Cash App Taxes provides an online alternative to doing your taxes on paper. It takes control of the whole process like a human tax preparer in an office might do, asking you questions and recording your answers. You simply read the questions on the page and provide answers by clicking buttons or entering data before moving on to the next set.,As you answer that app's questions, Cash App Taxes works in the background to enter your answers on the correct lines of the appropriate forms and schedules. It does all the necessary calculations, too. If you run into an unfamiliar concept, you might see help content. ,When you finish answering all the questions that pertain to your federal tax situation, Cash App Taxes transfers the relevant data over to your state return, if you're required to file one. When your tax return is done, Cash App Taxes reviews your return for errors and possible missed deductions, and lastly helps you file or print your return. All personal tax preparation services work this way, more or less.,To start using Cash App Taxes, you have to go through an unusual set of steps, starting with signing up for a Cash App account if you don't already have one. It doesn't require much, just your birth date, the last four digits of your Social Security number, and a few other details. You can also connect an external bank account if you want to be able to move funds from your account to Cash App and vice versa.,Logging into Cash App Taxes requires multiple steps, though the process has been changed since last year. It no longer requires a QR code, but it still requires multiple steps that get tiresome. To open Cash App Taxes on your browser, you first have to download the Cash App app on your iOS or Android mobile device. ,You then go to the site on your desktop or laptop and enter your smartphone number. Cash App Taxes then texts you a link. You click on it to verify that it is indeed you, though sometimes in testing I got a six-digit code to enter instead. Then you have to enter your password or set up biometrics to log in. Once you're logged in on your phone, the full application opens in your desktop browser.,If you walk away from your computer and the site remains inactive for a few minutes, it closes, and you have to go through the whole process again. I recommend taking care every time you log in. I spun my wheels for a while once when I had done something in the wrong order.,Alternatively, you can sign in through your mobile browser if you prefer. More on that later.,Cash App Taxes' user interface is attractive, intuitive, simple, and clean. A pleasing combination of fonts and colors adds to the well-designed layout. Graphics are minimal and some pages are absolutely unadorned, which probably contributes to how quickly pages load. The content of each page takes up only about a quarter of the screen, right in the middle, leaving lots of white space. It looks very much like it was designed for a mobile-first experience.,The vertical list of tax topics is arranged more or less the way you would work your way through Form 1040 and its supporting documentation, similar to the go-it-alone option other sites like , offer. ,No matter where you are in Cash App Taxes, you can click a link in the upper right and select from the drop-down menu the option to return to the tax homepage. Once you finish a topic, you automatically return to the tax homepage to work on another topic. You can also view PDF versions of all the actual tax forms where you've entered information at any point in your journey.,Progressing through the site is easy. Sometimes, you simply click Yes or No buttons to move on. Other pages have Back and Continue buttons. Once you enter a topic area, Cash App Taxes makes statements or poses questions on every page. Some pages contain blank fields for your answers. Sometimes you select an option from a drop-down list or click a button to provide your response. ,When you encounter an exceptional number of questions, like those supporting Schedule C, you can toggle back and forth between a full-form view and one that reduces the number of questions on each page. This view is unique to Cash App Taxes.,Once you're logged in, Cash App Taxes asks you a series of questions about, for example, your filing status, dependents, and your 2022 income and expenses. Cash App Taxes uses this information to tailor your online experience. It also asks if you want to directly link your tax data to Cash App, which provides more (and faster) refund deposit options. You must also enter personal details for everyone in your family, such as their names, addresses, and Social Security numbers, as well as answer some standard 1040-related questions. You see a summary when you're done.,I had used Cash App Taxes last year (for testing), so it transferred that data over to this year's return and asked me to verify whether specific tax topics applied again for the 2022 tax year. Then it launched the main website, where I was presented with a series of pages asking me to verify my personal information as I input it in 2021. My Social Security number was missing, and when I tried to move on, I saw, “Whoops! We found an error.” I added the number and was allowed to continue.,Most other tax prep websites also insist you complete a page accurately before advancing to the next. Once you complete the Basic Info section in Cash App Taxes, however, you can skip around and complete topics out of order. I don't recommend it, though. You’re less likely to miss something if you go in the prescribed order.,The topics you selected when you first answered questions appear in Cash App Taxes' home page. This Tax Home page is how you navigate the site. It consists of a series of green oblong blocks divided into Info, Income, Deductions/Credits (Expenses), and State, labeled with their content (such as W-2, Self-Employed, Home, and Medical Expenses). ,If you haven't visited a topic yet, you see a button that says Start. If you have, it says Edit/Review. When you click one of these buttons, the site walks you through a Q&A for that topic, asking detailed questions about your income and expenses and transferring your answers to official IRS forms and schedules in the background. ,For example, when you click Savings & Interest, the site assumes, based on your earlier input, that you need to enter a 1099-INT. After reminding you Cash App Taxes doesn’t cover interest earned on foreign bank accounts or funds from foreign trusts, it displays the Add New Interest Form button. Click it, and the next page contains fields for the Payer name and Federal ID number, and an optional account number. The next page includes fields for the information on your 1099-INT. You fill the required values in and click Continue. ,One limitation here is you can't import interest or investment data from another source. You always have to fill it in manually. The final page lets you enter up to $300 in the Foreign tax paid field ($600 if married filing jointly). Three more pages contain questions, and then you see a summary of your interest income. You can either add information from another Form 1099-INT or return to Tax Home to start another topic. You repeat this process until you reach the end of the interview Q&A.,A word about entering W-2s: If your organization uses ADP for payroll, you should be able to import your form data directly from ADP without having to enter anything. New this year, you can also import it from Square Payroll.,If not, you can upload a picture or scan of your W-2. Cash App Taxes automatically transfers the information from the form to the correct fields (I was unable to test it). Precision is critical here, and the company stresses you should always double-check your numbers. You also have the option to enter the information manually.,“Self-employed” can mean a variety of things. You may have a full- or part-time small business. You could also have side gigs, like driving for a rideshare company or sales on Etsy or eBay. Or maybe you’re an independent contractor who works for one or more clients regularly. Cash App Taxes supports Schedule C (business income), Form 1099-K (Payment card and third-party network income), Form 1099-MISC, and Form 1099-NEC (Non-employee compensation). It also supports Schedule K-1 (Partnership or Shareholder Income) and Sale of business property.,1099 forms are easy. You just enter the data on the form you received in the correct fields in Cash App Taxes. It’s Schedule C that can be a bear. You provide basic details about you and your business, like your address, business type, 1099 requirements, and prior year losses. Then you answer even more questions (Did you materially participate? Start or acquire the business in 2021? Cash or accrual?). ,Cash App Taxes then wants to know what your gross receipts or sales were and your returns and allowances, other income, and merchant card and third-party network payments. The latter should have been entered elsewhere on a 1099-K. Everyone who made $20,000 or more in sales processed through a bank or third-party payment network like PayPal or Square should receive a 1099-K for 2022.,You then enter your expenses by category, such as advertising, office expenses, insurance, and so on. Some of the categories, like Supplies, could use a bit more explanation, but Cash App Taxes provides only cursory descriptions in most cases. More examples would be helpful here to make your job easier and make errors less likely.,Once you enter all your expenses, you answer questions about the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, which is a very complex topic, with minimal guidance provided. After that, Cash App Taxes walks you through topics like business use of home (again, more guidance would be helpful), vehicle and other expenses, health insurance and long-term care payments you made for you and your family, and depreciation (this topic is explained in greater depth than some others). Cash App Taxes highlights the most common answers, as it does throughout, but allows you to change them.,Cash App Taxes can handle the mechanics of Schedule C just fine. If you’re just claiming income and expenses as a rideshare driver, for example, Cash App Taxes should work for you. Keep in mind, though, that if you’re trying to claim the business use of your home for deduction or any other complicated business tax topics, you get minimal assistance from the help system compared with what competitors offer. You might have to resort to following links to IRS sites, which Cash App Taxes offers on some pages.,Anyone who has ever prepared their own taxes knows questions always arise and getting quality help is absolutely critical. Cash App Taxes hasn't had many years to build up the support resources that its competitors have, so the guidance it offers is still sparse in comparison. But I wouldn’t expect TurboTax-level support from an absolutely free product. Cash App Taxes does a fairly good job of letting you know what it's looking for on every page, but it doesn't hyperlink complex terms the way , does, for example.,A small circled ""i"" shows up at the end of many lines. It links to brief explanations of the current topic, but some are sketchy, and others are not particularly useful. Take the qualified business income deduction, for example. Granted, it's an exceptionally complex area of tax law that can be puzzling even to financial professionals, but there's very little information provided for a deduction that can save some businesses a lot of money.,This lack of detail occurs at various points. As mentioned, Cash App Taxes sometimes directs you to consult an IRS publication, which is a serious drawback for a tax website help system (a few competitors are guilty of doing the same thing). Cash App Taxes does generally rephrase tax law into simpler terms for most topics, but not in nearly as much depth and breadth as rival sites do. Again, I wouldn’t expect much more of a free tax prep service, but be forewarned.,There are two additional ways to get help. Click the three dots in the upper right, and the Tax Help Center opens in a new tab. Here, you can enter a search term or phrase, or browse topics by category. Some of the educational content is quite good, simple, and well written. There are usually links to at least a couple of relevant articles, but the additional links sometimes veer off into unrelated areas. For example, I landed on ”Should I use the Standard Mileage Rate or Actual Vehicle Costs to calculate vehicle expenses?” while looking for information on medical expenses.,Other tax prep sites also dribble off into answers to questions you didn't ask, similar to how a generic Google search works. H&R Block, however, is much better at returning relevant, helpful answers to searches. ,The last way to get help is to click the question mark in the upper right, which opens a list of links to context-sensitive FAQs, some of which are identified as coming from healthcare.gov and IRS.gov. I found them to be more helpful—and faster—than the dedicated Tax Help Center. When I entered ""medical expenses,"" it showed multiple jumps to related forms (but also to some seemingly unrelated or marginally related forms). ,If you're stumped, you can start a chat with a Cash App Taxes support team member during the tax season, though you can only get technical site help—not the professional tax help so many competitors offer. You can also submit an email. My emails were answered very quickly. I used the main Cash App chat function for a problem with my PIN, and my request for help was dealt with promptly and efficiently.,After you complete every relevant section, Cash App Taxes reviews your answers. If it finds errors or omissions, it shows you the offending pages so you can fix them. This worked very well in my testing. Cash App Taxes also makes suggestions about where you might be able to save money. For example, it told me I might be eligible for the Dependent Care Credit since I had reported a dependent.,The best way to access Cash App Taxes on mobile is to open Cash App and click on ""Free tax filing"" on the Money tab. The mobile tax-filing experience was very similar to what I saw via my desktop. The only real difference is the smaller display, which affects the positioning of some help content and the navigation menu. Like the desktop version, the app is fast and free. It also looks great and uses the same data entry conventions as the desktop version.,Help works the same way on a mobile device as it does on the desktop website, though FAQs and article content take up the whole screen instead of overlapping. Cash App Taxes was a pleasure to use on mobile, working so well it would be easy to complete even a complex return there—as long as you don't need a lot of tax help.,Cash App Taxes supports major IRS forms and schedules at no charge for either federal or state preparation and filing. That said, it's still missing some forms. Furthermore, some complex topics like investment sales don't receive the step-by-step data entry and guidance that sites like TurboTax offer. A personal tax prep service must have exceptional help resources if it hopes to serve taxpayers who need to wrestle with complicated topics like rental property income and small business income. Cash App Taxes provides the tools for dealing with such complexity, but its guidance is still lacking compared with the competition. ,If you’re going to need the extra help and want an exceptional user experience and comprehensive coverage of tax topics, we recommend you consider one of our Editors’ Choice winners, H&R Block or TurboTax. H&R Block's always-on context-sensitive help is a real plus, and its user interface is more compact and contained. TurboTax is better for reporting investment transactions and has a bit of an edge in helping to report self-employment income. They’re certainly more expensive than Cash App Taxes, but paying for the best personal tax preparation experience might save you money in missed deductions—and possible penalties for improperly filed taxes.,If you have a relatively simple return or you know your way around a 1040, Cash App Taxes might serve you well. If either—or better, both—of these conditions apply to you, give it a shot. It's free after all, and if there's one thing everyone thinks about at tax time, it's dollars and cents.,While you're thinking about your money, read our roundup of the ,.

"Arlo Reverses Course, Will Continue to Offer Free Cloud Storage for Old Cameras","The end-of-life and support cut-off dates are also being extended in a response to the backlash.,I've been working at PCMag since November 2016, covering all areas of technology and video game news. Before that I spent nearly 15 years working at Geek.com as a writer and editor.

Elon Musk: We're Curbing Starlink's Use in Ukraine to Prevent WWIII,"Former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly calls on Musk to 'restore the full functionality' of SpaceX's Starlink system in Ukraine, where it's being used to launch drone strikes.,I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming. Prior to working at PCMag, I was a foreign correspondent in Beijing for over five years, covering the tech scene in Asia.,Elon Musk this weekend defended SpaceX's decision to curtail Ukraine’s use of the , satellite internet system to launch drone strikes against Russia, citing the threat of “escalation.”,""Starlink is the communication backbone of Ukraine, especially at the front lines, where almost all other Internet connectivity has been destroyed,” Musk ,. “But we will not enable escalation of conflict that may lead to WW3.”,Days earlier, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell , the company had taken steps to limit the Ukrainian military’s ability to use Starlink to pilot unmanned drones on the frontlines of the war. ""It was never intended to be weaponized,” Shotwell said of Starlink’s battlefield uses. “On the other hand, they are trying to fight for their country.”,Still, the decision isn’t sitting well with everyone. On Twitter, former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly called on Musk to lift the restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Starlink. “Please restore the full functionality of your Starlink satellites. Defense from a genocidal invasion is not an offensive capability. It’s survival. Innocent lives will be lost,” Kelly , on Friday. ,Musk responded: “You’re smart enough not to swallow media and other propaganda bs.” ,In a separate ,, Musk added: “SpaceX commercial terminals, like other commercial products, are meant for private use, not military, but we have not exercised our right to turn them off. We’re trying hard to do the right thing, where the ‘right thing’ is an extremely difficult moral question.”,The ethics over weaponizing Starlink occurs when both the US and European allies have , millions to bring the satellite internet system to Ukraine. At least one government official in Ukraine has also publicly , SpaceX to lift the restrictions. ,Russia, on the other hand, has made veiled threats to attack Starlink, citing its use in Ukraine.

Before that I spent nearly 15 years working at Geek.com as a writer and editor. I also spent the first six years after leaving university as a professional game designer working with Disney, Games Workshop, 20th Century Fox, and Vivendi.,A Lockheed Martin training jet has logged more than 17 hours of flight time under the control of ,, which counts as a first for a tactical aircraft.,The VISTA X-62A is a modified F-16D Block 30 Peace Marble Il upgraded with Block 40 avionics. On board is a combination of the VISTA Simulation System (VSS), Model Following Algorithm (MFA), and System for Autonomous Control of the Simulation (SACS).

Jackson Hewitt Online 2023 (Tax Year 2022) Review,"Affordable tax preparation from a familiar name,I write about money. I’ve been reviewing tax software and services as a freelancer for PCMag since 1993. Along the way, I took on reviews of other types of business and personal finance technology. Prior to that, I had spent a few years writing about productivity and entertainment applications for 8-bit personal computers (my first one was a Commodore VIC-20) as a member of the editorial staff at , ,Online tax service Jackson Hewitt offers attractive pricing and the option to have pros prepare your return—if you bring your paperwork to one of its brick-and-mortar locations and pay more. While it supports all major IRS forms and schedules, its UI and help system can't match the competition.,Jackson Hewitt has been known for in-person tax preparation for more than 40 years. The company has more than 5,500 brick-and-mortar locations in the US, roughly 3,000 of them located in Walmart stores. That said, Jackson Hewitt's in-person expertise hasn't translated well enough to its , to justify recommending it. Confusing navigation tools and substandard help remain our biggest complaints. ,This year, the company has focused on incorporating ,, as well as making general improvements to its forms and help text. Its price makes the service appealing to taxpayers who are looking for an affordable way to prepare and file their taxes, but , and , are,our Editors’ Choice winners for 2023, even though they're much more expensive. ,Jackson Hewitt used to offer three different versions of its online DIY tax preparation solutions at varying prices. Now there's just one, at $25, which includes filing for both a federal and state return. That's a low price. This year's version supports all major IRS forms and schedules, so you should be able to complete complex returns, even those involving self-employment income and expenses. ,For comparison, H&R Block Self-Employed, which you would need if you wanted to access a similar set of forms and schedules, has a suggested retail price of $110, with state returns adding $37 each. TurboTax Self-Employed is $119 for federal and $54 per state. , is $49.95 plus $39.95 per state. , is $64.95 for federal, $44.95 state, though we expect its prices to go up later in the filing season. ,One free option is , (formerly Credit Karma Tax), which costs nothing for both federal and state filing. Another is ,, which is free for federal returns, though you'll pay $14.99 per state. Both Cash App Taxes and FreeTaxUSA support all major forms and schedules, so you can report self-employment income and expenses. However, you sacrifice quite a bit (especially with Cash App Taxes) when it comes to handholding, which can be essential during the tax preparation process.,Jackson Hewitt offers three additional ways to prepare and file your taxes, besides doing them yourself online: You can schedule an in-office visit, go to a participating Walmart, or drop off your tax documents at any Jackson Hewitt location. For that last option, you'll be matched with a Tax Pro who asks and answers any questions via chat or phone. When your return is done, you can review it and e-sign it so Jackson Hewitt can file it for you. ,Jackson Hewitt employs a layered defense strategy, as its competitors do. , is supported though not required, and all data you transmit from your computer or phone is encrypted. In addition, you're notified about any account activity, like a password reset or e-file submission.,Most tax preparation websites work the same way, though they vary greatly in support and user experience. They're much easier to use than the old pencil-and-paper method that forces you to switch back and forth between Form 1040 and its related forms, schedules, and instructions. ,Tax sites remove that back-and-forth burden from the process. In general, they're conversational. step-by-step wizards that ask you questions and give you easy ways to enter answers. If you aren't sure what a particular question or statement means, you can consult a variety of built-in help resources. Most tax prep sites offer help by chat, phone, or email. You never have to see an official IRS form or instruction (though that's sometimes an option), and the guidance is often written in easy-to-understand terms.,As you respond to questions, the website prepares your actual return in the background. These websites—even the totally free Cash App Taxes—do all required calculations and drop your answers onto the correct lines of the correct IRS documents. When you think you have entered every detail that pertains to your tax-related financial life, the app or website reviews everything and alerts you to any problems or omissions. If you need to file a state return, the service automatically copies over any relevant data from your federal form and helps you prepare the state filing.,Many tax prep websites let you import your previous year's tax return, even if you prepared it using a competing service, to help you get started on the current year's taxes. Jackson Hewitt does not. You can leverage last year's tax return only if you also filed one with Jackson Hewitt. Not being able to import returns from other tax sites is a big drawback for anyone who is otherwise drawn in by Jackson Hewitt's low pricing.,If you've never used Jackson Hewitt before, you first need to create an account. You enter a unique username and password, select and answer security questions, and optionally set up multi-factor authentication. The site then asks for your name and address, filing status, Social Security number, and so on. If you filed with Jackson Hewitt online last year, the site populates those fields automatically when you log in (it worked well for me). The site also presents a list of forms you completed for the prior tax year and asks if you want them included. You still must review and edit all the information that auto-populates. ,Setup could be faster if the site asked more than one question per page. As it stands, there's a , of clicking. The same problem plagues some other sections of the Q&A process as well.,Once you complete those introductory pages, the site asks about W-2s and other sources of income. It then goes on to cover dependents, deductions and credits, health care, and other tax situations before transferring relevant data over to any state returns you must file and checking your return for errors.,There are two ways to move through the site. If you're an experienced tax filer or have a simple return, you can select the topics you want to visit. In the Income section, for example, topics include W-2s, business income, and investment sales. You select one from the main list, go through its questions, and return to the list for more. Every section (such as income and deductions) has a homepage in this sense.,If you have a complex return, are new to tax preparation, or just want to make sure you don't miss anything, you can use the sequential interview option. This wizard-driven option takes you all the way through the 1040 and supporting documents, asking questions about every topic covered by the service.,Jackson Hewitt does an acceptable job of describing what it's looking for, but some sites, like TurboTax, provide lengthier, more detailed, and more clearly written explanations. Jackson Hewitt sometimes asks multiple questions for an uncomplicated topic and then gives short shrift to others that rival sites explore more thoroughly. For example, it devotes only one field to the total of your medical and dental expenses, but it breaks down charitable donations by type.,In terms of navigating your way around the site, Jackson Hewitt has some irregularities. When you log in after being gone, for example, the site doesn't ask whether you want to return to the last page visited, the way TaxSlayer and others do. ,If you get partway through a lengthy section and have to stop, there's often a link that says, ""Save my progress…I'll finish this form later."" But there's no comprehensive navigation outline that would allow you to get back to that place in the form quickly when you return. I had to click through numerous pages I'd already completed to get back to where I'd left off.,If you click Cancel without saving, a small window opens, warning you to save before you leave. I couldn’t even open a help page without saving, and then I was sent back to the beginning of the Q&A I was working on and had to click through multiple pages again. Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax are the only sites I've tested that require occasional manual saving, which gives them a dated feel. Autosaving is a more convenient solution that makes it less likely you'll lose work. So save frequently if you use them!,With Jackson Hewitt, I had to spend too much time backtracking and was unable to see a comprehensive view of everything I'd done—something standard in tax preparation services, even FreeTaxUSA.,In addition, the site's graphics, fonts, layout, and design are uninspiring. Jackson Hewitt's design falls well short of sites such as TurboTax and H&R Block. Its user interface simply isn't compelling, which is a problem for an application that requires a significant (and often stressful) time commitment. Some taxpayers may not mind. You'll do a lot of your work in the upper-left corner, which is where single questions appear frequently, with a yawning expanse of the page left blank. TurboTax and H&R Block show that an attractive design makes an appreciable difference in the process.,The Jackson Hewitt tax prep site allows you to complete a Schedule C, but guidance is lacking for what may be a difficult form to complete. You have to answer numerous general questions about your business (including total income) before the site gets to the hard part: entering expenses. All of Schedule C’s expense categories are on one page with brief descriptions. You can either enter totals for each category or break them out into individual types for your own bookkeeping purposes. For example, under Advertising, you might have an entry for Facebook ads and another for business cards. ,Other elements of self-employment are included in the business walk-through too, like the home office deduction, depreciation, and vehicle expenses. They're handled well, with a separate set of questions for each. The site also asks about 1099-NECs and 1099-MISCs, both of which could contain self-employment income. If you happen to miss them in the Q&A interview, you can search for them. ,Competitors like TurboTax and H&R Block provide extra guidance for 1099-Ks this year. This form goes out to self-employed individuals who have more than $20,000 reported income through third-party payment processors (like PayPal), among other taxpayers. Congress was going to drop that threshold to $600 for the 2022 tax year but ,. Tax prep websites had been gearing up for an onslaught of hobbyists and small businesspeople to suddenly receive this unfamiliar form—hence, the extra attention from some companies. Jackson-Hewitt, though, provides minimal information about it.,Jackson-Hewitt handles the mechanics of entering self-employment income and expenses just fine. But again, help is minimal. Considering that millions of gig workers must file Schedule C, even for a small amount of income, the site could use more guidance on this topic. ,User experience is important, but the quality, accessibility, and depth of help resources are more critical. Websites that excel in this area, such as TurboTax, provide instant help for most topics and certainly the most complicated ones. They hyperlink terms and open small windows or vertical panes with clearly written, understandable explanations, or they anticipate issues and make brief Q&As available on the same page as the questions.,Jackson Hewitt falls short here, too. The quality and quantity of help don't compare favorably with competitors. The only context-sensitive help on the data-gathering pages is an occasional hyperlinked question or statement. For example, when I was answering questions (one to a page) about my small business, it asked if I’d had to refund any money to customers. But the Help hyperlink asked if I’d received a 1099-K. The help window that opened said that refund information wasn’t reported on the 1099-K, and I’d get the form from my bookkeeper or the site operator. I'm not sure why it asked that particular question at that time, but it was repeated on at least one additional unrelated page.,When I clicked the Help link, I could enter a search term, chat with support staff, or send an email. The hits that came back from my searches were primarily links to related forms. Occasional FAQs that appeared weren't relevant. Once I'd finished the help page, there was no way to easily return to the topic I had been working on, because help doesn't open in a separate window. I had to find my way back through the main navigation pane. ,Jackson Hewitt does stop you on pages where you haven't supplied required information. It grays out the Next button so you can’t move forward. When I tried to enter mortgage interest without providing a lender address, for example, the Next button remained gray and I couldn't go on. My only options were to go back or cancel. When I canceled, I was allowed to proceed and work on later sections of the return, something some competitors don't allow. Some competitors do allow you to proceed, though, creating a bookmark for pages with missing information so you remember to go back and complete them.,Jackson Hewitt's final review is good. It caught errors created because I saved some sections without completing them (where data wasn’t required). For example, it told me I hadn't completed all the pages for dividends. Once I completed them and clicked Save, it returned me to the main review page. I was also able to review forms I'd completed and add more, as well as search for others I might have missed. It'd be great to have access to this directory of forms and topics much earlier in the process, though it's good to have it available. ,Jackson Hewitt doesn't have mobile tax-preparation apps, but the website does have a responsive design, meaning you can open a mobile-friendly version on your phone or tablet. I tested the process of filing taxes on a Samsung Galaxy.,The company does a good job of replicating the tax preparation experience for the small screen. As with the desktop site, it offers two data-entry options: You can either select the topics you need to complete or use the step-by-step walk-through. The user interface is fine, though not at all innovative, but at least the content is thorough. I actually enjoyed using the mobile version more than the desktop version because the screen area was used more effectively.,Using Jackson Hewitt on a mobile device didn't solve any of the problems I found in the desktop version, however. There’s still no comprehensive navigation outline. The navigation tool that slides out when you click a link in the upper-left corner divides the site into very broad areas, like Federal and State, with few subtopics. You end up clicking the Back and Next buttons a lot. The site doesn't automatically save when you advance to the next page; sometimes you have to do it manually. There's little context-sensitive help, and searching for words or phrases often returns only a list of forms, not explanatory text.,Jackson Hewitt rarely changes from year to year, and this year is no exception. It may appeal to some taxpayers because of its new pricing, but the user experience needs improvement and navigating the site can be problematic. Plus, the built-in help tools don't measure up to those of some lower-cost or free products, like FreeTaxUSA. If you used it last year and liked it, there's no reason to change, though, unless your tax situation has gotten more complicated or you want a better user experience. ,That said, if you experienced life changes over the last year that you think will affect your taxes, you might want to consider an online tax service with more robust help and a better user experience. H&R Block and TurboTax are our Editors’ Choice winners this year—no competitor has yet matched or exceeded those services in terms of coverage of tax topics, usability, and support.,While you're thinking about your money, read our roundup of the , If you run a small business, we have you covered with the ,.,Online tax service Jackson Hewitt offers attractive pricing and the option to have pros prepare your return—if you bring your paperwork to one of its brick-and-mortar locations and pay more.

I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).,The DualSense Edge is the best premium controller for the PlayStation 5, but its short battery life means you should keep a charging cable close by.,The , introduced one of the most advanced , ever created with the DualSense. The DualSense has features from previous controller generations, such as motion controls, a touchpad, and a built-in speaker, and adds incredibly accurate haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that drastically change their resistance based on your in-game actions. Now you can go a step further with the $199.99 DualSense Edge, Sony’s answer to Microsoft’s ,. It contains the expected DualSense features, plus programmable inputs and analog sensitivity options, rear buttons, numerous accessories, and a modular design that lets you completely replace an analog stick module if it fails. Its battery life isn’t the best and you’ll need to do some work to make it compatible with a PC, but it's a worthwhile splurge for PS 5 fanatics.,At a glance, the DualSense Edge looks and feels like a standard white DualSense controller, but with a black touchpad, direction pad, and face buttons. The two-tone color scheme gives the controller a much more balanced look. Just below the analog sticks are the first big indications that this is a different gamepad: two tab-like buttons. These are the Fn buttons, and holding them lets you switch between four different controller profiles on the fly.,Flip the controller over, and you’ll find other indicators that this isn’t an ordinary DualSense. Small holes between the grips let you insert one of two types of paddles that act as programmable buttons, much like the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller and other high-end gamepads. Between those holes is a recessed release switch for the controller's front panel, along with a pinhole reset button. Above that section, just below the triggers, are three-way trigger lock switches.,Like any good premium controller, the DualSense Edge has many accessories and swappable parts. It comes with two pairs of concave-topped analog sticks (two long, two short) that can be swapped with the gamepad's standard, lipped-concave sticks. There are also two pairs of levers (one flat and paddle-like and one shorter and half-circle-shaped) that let you add rear buttons. Included in the package is a long, fabric-wrapped USB-C-to-USB-A cable for charging and using the controller in wired fashion, plus a clip-on lock that attaches to the gamepad's top for keeping the USB-C end in place. All of these parts fit in a white, hard-shell case.,One of the most interesting DualSense Edge aspects is the analog stick modules. You can switch the stick caps by pulling them off and replacing them with others, but that’s not where the modularity stops. The tiny release switch on the controller's back lets you remove the center panel around the analog sticks; that reveals the stick modules and two metal release levers. If an analog stick drifts or otherwise starts working poorly, you can replace it with a new one that you can order from Sony for $19.99. It’s a useful way to fight stick drift without purchasing a new controller.,The DualSense Edge has all of the unique capabilities of the DualSense, which I tested using Astro’s Playroom on the PlayStation 5. The controller delivers precise haptic feedback, variable trigger resistance depending on the situation, and motion sensors, a speaker, and a microphone that work as intended.,Because the Edge acts just like a DualSense, you’ll get the most out of it when using the gamepad with a PlayStation 5. It works with a PC over Bluetooth or a wired connection, but you must , using ,’s PlayStation Configuration Support menu or ,. Even then, you won’t have any of the audio connectivity, haptic feedback (beyond basic vibration), and adaptive triggers, since they need to be implemented in each game. ,Unlike the Xbox Elite controller, the DualSense Edge doesn’t make you download and use a separate app to set it up. Plugging the DualSense Edge into your PlayStation 5 pairs the controller and launches the system-level controller options. It also loads a tutorial on how to use those options to create controller profiles, adjust button mapping and analog stick and trigger sensitivity, and how to use the Fn buttons to switch between profiles.,The PlayStation 5’s options for the DualSense Edge are as extensive as the Xbox Accessories app’s options for the Xbox Elite controller. You can remap every digital input and assign inputs to the two rear buttons (the Xbox Elite has four). You can also adjust the analog sticks and triggers' sensitivity curves and dead zones, with several different premade curves designed for specific game types.,You can’t reprogram the Fn buttons below the analog sticks, but this makes sense considering how they’re used. Holding one and pressing the face buttons changes the active profile, while pressing the direction pad adjusts headset volume and chat/game balance. Both Fn buttons do the same thing, because it would otherwise be awkward to hold the right button and switch profiles (or hold the left button and control audio). Still, the option to map the buttons to other functions would have been welcome (perhaps with a separate profile button), especially since it would have bumped the custom input number to match the Xbox Elite’s.,After testing the controller functions with Astro’s Playroom, I played a few games on the PlayStation 5 with it. , played well with the controller, and Axiom Verge 2 felt great due to its responsive analog stick and direction pad.,I also played ,. I set the rear buttons to trigger L3 and R3 so I could crouch and target enemies without my right thumb leaving the right analog stick. It worked perfectly, although it didn’t make Crumbling Farrum Azula any less difficult. I also missed having an additional two rear buttons like on the Xbox Elite controller, which would have let me switch spells and items without removing my left thumb from the left analog stick.,I then played a round of Gundam Evolution, setting the analog stick sensitivity to Dynamic. The Dynamic preset is designed for shooters, with low sensitivity as you start to move the stick for more accuracy while aiming, then jumping to high sensitivity quickly to be able to turn fast. The curve was slightly odd at first, but I found myself easily lining up head shots with the GM Sniper. It didn’t make me any better at the game, but aiming and shooting felt good with some adjustments.,The DualSense Edge's biggest weakness is its battery life. The gamepad ,, two-thirds the size of the DualSense’s 1,560mAh cell. It delivered five or six hours of wireless playtime before the low battery icon appeared and I had to plug it into the PS5. ,The long, sturdy cable let me play while the controller charged, but the controller's battery doesn’t last as long as the base DualSense, which is already modest at around eight hours. It also can’t hold a candle to the Xbox Elite’s rechargeable battery, or even the standard Xbox Wireless Controller with two AA batteries. Both Microsoft options last at least twice as long and get you through a good week or so of regular playing.,The DualSense Edge takes the already cutting-edge DualSense controller and makes it better with swappable parts, programmable inputs and sensitivity, and rear buttons. However, its battery life is disappointing, and its additional control options are more limited than the Xbox Elite due to having just two rear buttons. That said, as Sony’s long-awaited “pro” PlayStation 5 controller, the Edge performs as well as the regular DualSense and we like all of the extra features it brings. Sure, the controller is expensive, but it’s currently the best premium gamepad for the PS5. It isn’t the best choice for PC, though; for that, you should consider the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller. ,The DualSense Edge is the best premium controller for the PlayStation 5, but its short battery life means you should keep a charging cable close by.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

TP-Link Deco X4300 Pro Review,"Is there anywhere this mesh kit's Wi-Fi can't go?,I’ve been working with computers for ages, starting with a multi-year stint in purchasing for a major IBM reseller in New York City before eventually landing at PCMag (back when it was still in print as ,). I spent more than 14 years on staff, most recently as the director of operations for PC Labs, before hitting the freelance circuit as a contributing editor. ,TP-Link's Deco X4300 Pro is a three-piece Wi-Fi 6 mesh system that offers very fast throughput and plenty of coverage, making it ideal for extra-large homes.,Designed to provide Wi-Fi 6 wireless coverage in every corner of a large house—up to 7,000 square feet—the TP-Link Deco AX4300 Pro ($399.99) is a three-piece , that offers several nice features, including a multi-gig WAN/LAN port, two 1GbE LAN ports, and TP-Link's HomeShield parental control and network security tools. In our testing, it delivered very fast throughput speeds plus exceptional wireless signal strength, and it took only minutes to install. The kit doesn't offer any USB ports for sharing an external solid-state or hard drive, but that's not uncommon among mesh systems and doesn't keep the X4300 Pro from claiming an Editors' Choice award among Wi-Fi 6 kits.,At $399.99 (though Best Buy had it for $299.99 at presstime), the three-piece X4300 Pro mesh system is more expensive than the two-piece , ($173.99) and the three-piece , ($299.99), but it covers much more ground. To put its 7,000 square feet in perspective, you'd have to spend $435 for five Wyze nodes or $538 for five Eero 6 Plus nodes to get 7,500 square feet of coverage.,The Deco X4300 Pro consists of three identical white cylindrical nodes, each standing 4.5 inches high and 4.3 inches wide. The top of each node has the same decorative swirl pattern used on earlier models such as TP-Link's ,. A small LED indicator at the bottom of each node glows yellow on startup, pulses blue when ready for setup, glows solid blue during setup, pulses green during a firmware update, and glows solid green when the node is connected and working properly. It glows red when there's a problem such as no connectivity.,The back of each node holds a 2.5GbE WAN/LAN port, two 1GbE LAN ports, and a power jack. As I said, the X4300 lacks the USB ports found on a few high-end mesh kits such as the ,. You'll find a reset button on the base. Under the hood are four internal antennas and circuitry supporting all the latest Wi-Fi 6 technologies including Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) data transmissions, MU-MIMO simultaneous data streaming, direct-to-client signal beamforming, WPA3 encryption, and 160MHz channel bandwidth. Note that the Deco X4300 Pro is not a , system and as such transmits at 2.4GHz and 5GHz but not over the 6GHz band. For that, you'll want to check out TP-Link's ,.,As a dual-band , system, the kit can hit theoretical data rates of up to 459Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and up to 3,843Mbps on the 5GHz band. Oddly, a TP-Link representative declined to tell me what kind of CPU and how much memory each node has, and the published product specifications lack this info. Most mainstream routers and mesh systems have dual- or quad-core processors, at least 512MB of RAM, and 4GB of flash memory to help route your data to and from your connected devices and the internet. ,The Deco X4300 Pro uses the same Deco mobile app as the abovementioned Deco XE75 Pro, but the app has recently been updated. Instead of opening to an Overview screen, it now presents a Network screen with Wi-Fi Settings tab and Guest Network tabs above a network map that displays all connected nodes by name. Below the map is an Online Clients panel, with a Smart Home panel beneath. At the very bottom of the screen are buttons labeled Network, Security, Parental Controls, and More.,Tap the Wi-Fi Settings tab to choose an encryption type (WPA2, WPA/WPA2, WPA3, WPA2/WPA3 Personal, or none) and edit your SSID and password. Here you can share your Wi-Fi credentials, select which radio band(s) will be enabled, and hide the SSID. The Guest Network tab is where you go to create a guest network that keeps your personal data safe from prying eyes.,The network map shows how many clients are connected to each node. Tapping a client lets you see its signal strength and family member profile. Here you can also give the client device bandwidth priority (also accessible by tapping the Online Clients panel and selecting a client). The Smart Home panel lets you control other installed TP-Link devices such as Kasa KL130 light bulbs from within the Deco app.,The Network button takes you back to the map screen from wherever you are, while the Security button opens a screen where you can perform a network scan that looks for performance issues, weak passwords, and firmware updates. The Parental Controls button lets you create user profiles and block websites, assign web filters, and set bedtime rules for each user. ,If you need more advanced parental controls and network security tools, you can subscribe to TP-Link's HomeShield Pro service. For $5.99 per month or $54.99 per year, HomeShield Pro offers parental control time limits, time rewards, and traffic statistics. For enhanced network security, the plan features malicious content filtering, port intrusion protection, safety statistics, online usage reports, and security reminders. ,Finally, you can tap the More button to open a screen where you can access the abovementioned Wi-Fi and Guest Network settings as well as QoS settings, a Network Optimization setting that scans and analyzes which channels are being used and selects the least congested ones, and notification alert settings. Advanced settings include IPTV/LAN, MAC Cloning and NAT Forwarding, and LAN and DHCP Server settings.,Like other TP-Link Deco mesh systems, the X4300 Pro was a snap to install. I already had the Deco app installed on my phone, so I tapped Let's Begin on the opening screen and selected the X4300 Pro from the long list of Deco kits. I powered off my modem, connected a node to it with the included LAN cable, and powered up both devices. I verified that the Deco node LED was pulsing blue and the app identified it immediately. I gave the node a location, selected Dynamic IP (the default) as a connection type, and gave the new network a name and password. I waited 30 seconds or so for the network to be created and for the app to run a quick connectivity test, tapped Next, and followed instructions to plug in the remaining nodes so they could be automatically added to the network. Once the nodes were recognized, I renamed them and updated the firmware to complete the installation. ,The X4300 Pro is an impressive performer. The router node returned a throughput score of 935Mbps in our close-proximity test, topping the Wyze Mesh router (914Mbps), the Asus ZenWiFi XT8 (860Mbps), and the , (895Mbps). It was barely slower than the Eero 6 Plus (938Mbps). ,In the 30-foot test, the X4300 Pro router node beat all comers by a healthy margin, delivering 549Mbps. The Eero 6 Plus router was next best at 367Mbps, ahead of the Asus (347Mbps), the Wyze Mesh router (322Mbps), and the Motorola (315Mbps).,The X4300 Pro satellite node also showed strong throughput. I measured 579Mbps in the close-proximity test, beating all but the ZenWiFi XT8 satellite (675Mbps). The Wyze Mesh satellite managed 488Mbps and the Eero 6 Plus satellite 538Mbps, while the Motorola satellite trailed at 441Mbps. At 30 feet, the Deco X4300 Pro satellite scored 551Mbps, again beating every other satellite except the Asus (619Mbps).,We test wireless signal strength with an , Sidekick diagnostic device and the company's Survey software. (Disclosure: Ekahau is owned by PCMag publisher Ziff Davis.) This combo generates a heat map that shows Wi-Fi signal strength throughout our test home.,The circle on the heat map represents the router's location and the colors represent signal strength: dark green for the strongest signal, lighter yellow for a weaker one, and gray for no measurable signal. As you can see, the Deco X4300 Pro did a great job of broadcasting a strong Wi-Fi signal throughout the entire home.,If you own a large home and want a powerful mesh system that'll deliver Wi-Fi 6 connectivity to every room, put the TP-Link Deco X4300 Pro on your short list. This kit, which offers multi-gig networking and uses three nodes to cover up to 7,000 square feet, performed wonderfully in our throughput testing and had no trouble delivering a strong signal throughout our test home, all at a relative value compared to its primary rivals.,Granted, you'll have to pay extra for TP-Link's advanced HomeShield features, but the parental control and network security software provided for free is still plenty powerful. Unless you insist on Wi-Fi 6E instead of 6, the Deco X4300 Pro easily claims an Editors' Choice award as a first-class mesh system.,TP-Link's Deco X4300 Pro is a three-piece Wi-Fi 6 mesh system that offers very fast throughput and plenty of coverage, making it ideal for extra-large homes.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Neil J. Rubenking,"When the IBM PC was new, I served as the president of the San Francisco PC User Group for three years. That’s how I met PCMag’s editorial team, who brought me on board in 1986. In the years since that fateful meeting, I’ve become PCMag’s expert on security, privacy, and identity protection, putting antivirus tools, security suites, and all kinds of security software through their paces.,Before my current security gig, I supplied PCMag readers with tips and solutions on using popular applications, operating systems, and programming languages in my ""User to User"" and ""Ask Neil"" columns, which began in 1990 and ran for almost 20 years. Along the way I wrote more than 40 utility articles, as well as Delphi Programming for Dummies and six other books covering DOS, Windows, and programming. I also reviewed thousands of products of all kinds, ranging from early Sierra Online adventure games to AOL’s precursor Q-Link.,In the early 2000s I turned my focus to security and the growing antivirus industry. After years working with antivirus, I’m known throughout the security industry as an expert on evaluating antivirus tools. I serve as an advisory board member for the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO), an international nonprofit group dedicated to coordinating and improving testing of anti-malware solutions.,Antivirus utilities,Security suites,Ransomware protection,Detection of malicious and fraudulent websites,Privacy protection,Identity theft remediation,Much of the testing I do, particularly testing with real-world ransomware, is just plain dangerous. To perform such tests safely, I sequester them inside virtual machines managed by VMWare Workstation. A low-end HP desktop serves for tasks that require a physical computer, such as performance testing. For cross-platform testing I use a MacBook Air, a Google Pixel 4, and a 6th-generation iPad.,I rely on my Delphi coding skills to create and maintain small applications. These include programs to check whether an antivirus correctly handled the malware it detected, launch dangerous URLs and record the security program’s reaction, and analyze the malware that I collect for use in testing. I also wrote a tiny browser and text editor for use in testing security apps that have predefined reactions for known products.,I do my writing and research on a Dell OptiPlex desktop, relying on Microsoft Word (my fingers know all the shortcuts). Many of my articles include charts and analysis; Excel is my go-to for those. When work hours end, though, I escape the bounds of Microsoft and Windows. There’s an iPhone in my pocket, I relax with my oversized iPad, and my Kindle Oasis is always loaded with the best science fiction and fantasy.,What's the best security software for keeping your PC safe? We've tested, reviewed, and rated nearly 40 apps to help you choose the top security suite for protecting your devices and data.,Keeping passwords on your own device seems safer than storing them in the cloud, right?

Forspoken Review,"Forspoken talks a lot, but doesn't say much,I’m a Junior Analyst and ISF-certified TV calibrator focused on reviewing computer accessories, laptops, gaming monitors, and video games. I’ve been writing, playing, and complaining about games for as long as I remember, but it wasn’t until recently that I’ve been able to shout my opinions directly at a larger audience. My work has appeared on iMore, Windows Central, Android Central, and TWICE, and I have a diverse portfolio of editing work under my belt from my time spent at Scholastic and Oxford University Press. I also have a few book-author credits under my belt—I’ve contributed to the sci-fi anthology , and I’ve even written a Peppa Pig book.,Forspoken would be a passable PlayStation title if it were released a decade ago, but it drops the ball as a contemporary AAA game due to its awkward voice performances, muddy visuals, and many bizarre design choices.,Developer Square Enix has been in a bit of a rut lately, releasing middling release after middling release (not counting well-received remasters of already excellent games like , and ,). It began last March with the disappointing Babylon’s Fall and the rough-around-the-edges ,. Sadly, the streak continues with Forspoken. Built using Square Enix’s hyped in-house game engine, the Luminous Engine, Forspoken was set to impress—until the first trailers hit the internet, and the game’s eye-rolling dialogue was memed to oblivion. ,Unfortunately, it turns out that gamers were right to be suspicious. The $69.99 , isn’t a good game. Forspoken has a few charms, but it falls flat on most levels, with disappointing graphics, poor voice performances, and shallow gameplay. Simply put, Forspoken is a B-tier game masquerading as a AAA title.,Forspoken begins by introducing Frey Holland, a young woman orphaned as a baby at the Holland Tunnel (hence her last name) who is frequently in trouble with the law. You can immediately tell that she’s “New York tough” thanks to the constant stream of swears she strings into sentences. Down on her luck after a theft gone wrong, she hopes to start a new life with nothing but a sack of cash and her cat, Homer. Unfortunately, her apartment is set on fire and she narrowly escapes, sans bag of life-changing cash. With no options available to her, Frey wanders the streets until she spots a golden glow that beckons her to a mysterious vambrace that warps her to the magical world of Athia.,Forspoken is an isekai, a subgenre of fantasy where a character is suddenly transported to an unfamiliar world. It's a popular , trope, though there are plenty of examples in the west, such as Lewis Carroll’s , or the 2001 Martin Lawrence vehicle, ,. When Frey arrives in Athia, the world's on the brink of destruction. It's maligned by a miasma called The Break, to which Frey is immune. The vambrace she swiped, which Frey nicknames Cuff, turns out to be sapient, extremely chatty, and gives her magical powers.,Let's start with the good—Forspoken’s traversal. Athia is a large open world, and Frey navigates it using magical parkour. Frey speeds across the landscape, hopping over obstacles and enemies with ease. The parkour feels great, and there's a tangible feeling of momentum (much like a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game). Then the parkour feels not so great, mainly when you crash against a wall or miss a jump that halts your free roam run (also like a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game).,That said, you'll beg for a wall run when you’re in Cipal, the hub city. For some reason, being there forces Frey to walk at a snail’s pace. In fact, the juxtaposition from the open world to these city moments are sure to give you whiplash, as the game slows down in just about every aspect, including dialogue, which I’ll touch on in the presentation section below.,More positively, magical parkour works its way into combat, giving you cool movement options along with flashy attacks. Frey has four different types of magic, creatively named after four different colors—Purple, Red, Blue, and Green. They let Frey manipulate earth, fire, water, and electricity, respectively.,Each magic type has three spells, and you can upgrade them using Mana collected in the wild or earned by leveling-up Frey. You also have support magic that typically buffs Frey while causing additional damage to the enemies. You control combat magic with the R2 button and support magic with the L2 button. ,Forspoken makes use of the DualSense controller's haptic triggers, so you tap them to fire a quick shot or hold them to charge the selected spell. Unfortunately, that results in clunky combat. Plus, three of the four magic attacks are ranged attacks, so fights mostly boil down to locking onto an enemy, and strafing back and forth. The rule of cool is in full effect, but ,, this is not.,At least upgrading Frey is somewhat interesting, as her cloak, necklace, and even nails augment her abilities and change her physical appearance. You can craft and upgrade equipment at safe houses littered across Athia, and find more by completing challenges in the standard open-world style.,Unfortunately, I was surprised by how certain actions were poorly explained. For example, the game grants you a zipline ability and locks you in place at a ledge with the instruction to hold and release the square button to zip to the other side. However, it wants you to zip to a specific point on the ledge; a point that is obscured by a massive objective marker. Moments like that made for frustrating play throughout the adventure. More surprising is the decision to keep the breadth of Frey’s abilities locked away until deep in the game. This is particularly egregious since Frey's limited kit makes Forspoken's opening hours some of the most painful I’ve dealt with in recent memory. ,Forspoken’s presentation has been a frustrating conversation topic since the game’s reveal, but now we can contextualize the cringe-inducing dialogue that circulated ahead of launch. It's still mostly cringey, though that's not the fault of the lead actress and model Ella Balinska, who is doing what she can with what she was given. With a setting developed by Gary Whitta (of ,y fame), a story concept by Amy Henning (of Uncharted fame), and story written by TV scribes Allison Rymer (,) and Todd Stashwick (,), you might expect something with a little more substance (or at least better paced). This is not the case.,Many AAA titles are guilty of “Whedon-esque” dialogue: forced attempts at humor, and trope-ridden storytelling. Forspoken is also guilty of this, but the dialogue is weak and lacks conviction. From important story beats to side missions, it sounds like the characters just don’t believe what they’re saying. Coupled with awkward cutscene direction (there is a shocking amount of pointless fade-outs), and some truly cursed side-quest interactions (interacting with the town minstrel is painful), the bad dialogue just adds to the sloppiness of it all. ,It’s even worse when the game stops for exposition dumps. You can skip the dialogue, but the game locks you in place to deliver dialogue options to ask Cuff. Why you can't talk and walk is beyond me.,Worse still, Frey and Cuff are an insufferable and unlikeable pair. Frey comes across as a selfish edgelord incapable of helping others, while Cuff is doing what can only be described as a sleepy Paul Bettany impression (less aloof, more disinterested). The NPCs are even worse, with many of them sounding like renaissance fair rejects. They also talk far too much. There’s an option to limit Cuff’s comments to just important information, and even that's overkill.,, which shadow-launched around the same time as Forspoken, delivers a constant stream of banter and goofy dialogue, but blends it with camp and cartoonish flourish, making these exchanges palatable, even enjoyable. Forspoken goes for melodrama, making the forced humor, pottymouth dialogue, and bland conversation all the more glaring.,To its credit, Forspoken has a few different display options. There’s Performance, which drops the resolution to reach a 60-frames-per-second cap; Quality, which drops the frame rate to 30fps, while prioritizing resolution; and Ray Tracing, which is similar to Quality, except that it delivers more realistic lighting and shadows. ,The game also uses , tech, which lowers the game's resolution and uses AI to upscale the image. You may not even notice the scaling at work when it's correctly implemented. In addition, the spell effects are particularly impressive, with many screen-filling particles. That said, particle effects and fine details like Frey’s hair leave behind tons of artifacts that create a noisy picture. It also gives environments a smeared look.,What saves Forspoken's visual aspect is the 120Hz mode, which lets the game reach 40fps while maintaining a good quality picture in Quality and Ray Tracing modes—it's the best of both worlds and is the ideal way to play Forspoken on the PlayStation 5. Just make sure you have a , that supports the refresh rate.,Unfortunately, , cranks the lighting to 100, ruining any scene that occurs in daylight. Sadly, there's no workaround outside of turning it off. Hopefully, Square Enix releases a patch to fix this in the near future.,Note: If you plan to play the game on PC, make sure to check out ,.,Square Enix’s biggest mistake was marketing this game as a AAA game, because it doesn’t feel like one. At its heart, Forspoken is a lost B-tier game from the PlayStation 3 era that washed ashore on modern consoles.

JBL Pulse 5 Review,"Impressive lighting above all else,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,The JBL Pulse 5 Bluetooth speaker casts impressively vibrant light, but mono sound and a dearth of physical controls give similarly priced competitors an advantage.,The JBL Pulse 5 ($249.95) is the latest entry in the company’s growing lineup of portable , with attention-grabbing LEDs. It’s also surprisingly durable, with a fully waterproof rating. But although it offers a rich, bright sound signature, it outputs only mono sound and lacks physical playback and volume buttons. Because of these limitations, we prefer the , ($179.99), which offers more compelling stereo audio, better onboard controls, and the same IP rating for less money—just keep in mind it doesn't match the Pulse 5's visual splendor.,The cylindrical Pulse 5 speaker measures roughly 8.5 by 4.2 by 5.2 inches (HWD) and weighs 3.3 pounds. It stands upright on three rubber feet that create a sliver of space for the down-firing, 2.5-inch 30W woofer and LEDs. Up top, a plastic grille with the JBL exclamation point logo protects the upward-firing, 0.6-inch 10W tweeter. We like that the design looks like a modern take on a lava lamp, but the glossy exterior shell unfortunately collects fingerprints easily. Those smudges are particularly visible when the speaker is off, but certain hues highlight them as well.,The dual drivers deliver mono audio, with a frequency range of 58Hz to 20KHz. The Pulse 5 is compatible with Bluetooth 5.3 and supports just the SBC ,, not AAC or AptX. That’s not ideal for the price but is forgivable for a portable speaker. If you want to hear more detail in your music, the pricier , ($349.99) supports the hi-res-capable LDAC codec. The aforementioned Soundcore Motion Boom Plus is better here as well because it works with the AAC codec.,On the back, you get buttons that control power, Bluetooth, lighting (a short press changes the mode, while a long press turns the LEDs on or off), and the PartyBoost function (which lets you link multiple JBL speakers for more directional sound). An LED battery indicator and a USB-C port for the included USB-C-to-USB-A charging cable are positioned below the control strip.,There aren't any onboard controls for playback, volume, or track navigation, an unwelcome change from the ,. You might appreciate the bold decision in light of the uncluttered surface, but we've tested plenty of , with a full range of controls. We can't recall the last time we tested a Bluetooth speaker without physical playback controls and know it will be a deal breaker for some. ,This might not look like the kind of speaker you can submerge at depths of up to a meter for 30 minutes, but it surprisingly carries an , rating. Bluetooth signals don’t work well underwater, but this level of durability means you can dunk or clean it to your heart's content. No amount of dirt it accumulates out on the trail should be a problem either. This rating is on par with most of JBL's other ,, such as the $349.95 ,, as well as the aforementioned Sony and Anker models.,JBL estimates that the Pulse 5 can last roughly 12 hours per charge, but your results will vary based on your typical listening volume level. The company claims that the 7,500mAh battery takes about four hours to fully charge from empty.,Aside from the missing playback controls, the Pulse 5 lacks a speakerphone function and an aux input. Neither are typical for the Pulse lineup, but either would have added some value to the package.,The JBL Portable app (available for Android and iOS) features a colorful, easy-to-navigate interface. It has a few more features than necessary but reliably delivers the essentials.,On the main screen, there's an image of the speaker and a battery life indicator. Below that, you see all the lighting options (we cover those in the next section). Further down, there's a customizable, three-band , (bass, mid, and treble); you can adjust the sound to taste or turn it off. Of course, we would prefer more customizable bands, but a simple EQ is better than none.,The app also has an Ambient Sound section that lets you play five sound loops (waves, crickets, a crackling fire, birds, or a creek). Interestingly, you can play any combination of those loops simultaneously, though selecting all five results in an unrelaxing cacophony of nature sounds. You can also set a timer for how long the loops play, but the maximum setting of an hour and the abrupt way the recordings end won't appeal to light sleepers. ,Otherwise, you can toggle the feedback tone (an audio prompt that plays when you press an onboard button), browse the user guide, update the firmware, and configure the Party Boost function.,The Pulse is at its best when it randomizes its lighting patterns: Fast-paced, multicolor splotches go off like out-of-focus fireworks. But when it lights up completely with color, the fade animations from one hue to another look a bit glitchy, almost like color banding on an older TV.,Additional controls let you set the light show theme (Canvas, Cocktail, Nature, Party, Spiritual, and Weather are all available by default, but you can add more) and color mode (the hue you select from the color wheel becomes the focus of the light show). The speaker reacts quickly to any changes you make in the app. ,Light emanates from both the body of the speaker and the raised base. You can adjust the brightness of each, turn either off, and adjust the tempo at which the light show syncs.,Overall, the Pulse 5 easily offers among the best, if not , best lighting experience of any portable Bluetooth speaker. Yes, some of the animations could be smoother, but the level of customization is the best we've seen.,We tested the speaker with the in-app EQ at neutral (default) settings. For a mono speaker, the Pulse 5 can get quite loud and its down-firing woofer delivers a palpable sense of bass. Even if the actual bass depth here is somewhat modest, the speaker produces some serious rumble.,On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” it outputs laudable bass depth. It doesn't distort at top volume levels, but that's because the , (DSP) thins out the bass. At more moderate volumes, you get a little more thump. ,The Pulse 5’s woofer can’t reproduce the sub-bass synth tones at the 34-second mark of Kendrick Lamar’s “Loyalty.” That's not a surprise in light of the speaker's size, but the drum loop still has a substantial thump. Vocal performances on the track sound clear, though a bit bright. The upward-firing tweeter tends to accentuate the higher frequencies.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, better reveals the sound signature. The drums on this track get an ideal amount of boosting for a bass-forward model. These elements sound full and far from muddy. The tweeter tacks on some high-mid and high-frequency presence, which lends a treble edge to Callahan’s baritone vocals and a brightness to the acoustic strums. Just note that the speaker scoops the mids a bit and sounds best from a relatively close distance. Beyond about 10 feet, the rich lows start to lose their fullness.,Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, exhibit a slightly elevated low-frequency response, but the higher-register brass, strings, and vocals clearly retain the spotlight with a brighter-than-normal delivery. That said, the speaker never sounds thin or brittle because of the warm lower frequencies. ,The JBL Pulse 5 offers among the best LED effects you can get in a portable speaker, despite some occasionally jittery animations. We’re also fans of its app-based lighting options and basic EQ. The speaker's mono driver setup sounds just fine, but the lack of physical playback and volume controls are frustrating. Overall, we prefer the more affordable Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Plus for its stereo sound and more convenient controls. And, if you have the budget for it, the pricier Sony SRS-XG300 is a worthwhile alternative with LDAC support and the same durability specs. However, neither of these options is quite as captivating as the Pulse 5 if you want to look at a light show while you listen to music.,The JBL Pulse 5 Bluetooth speaker casts impressively vibrant light, but mono sound and a dearth of physical controls give similarly priced competitors an advantage.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

NZXT H9 Elite Review,"Another Lian Li O11 competitor enters the ring,Years back, when a small website called out for product-review editors. I leapt at the opportunity: I’d just wrapped up a four-year stint as a systems supplier. That experience provided the credentials I’d need for the transition from industry supplier to industry observer. For one thing, I’d been the first source for an exposé on capacitor plague (,) at EDN. ,NZXT's H9 Elite PC case is a stunner in person, but anyone who can't figure out an advanced fan configuration to keep their components cool shouldn't expect performance that matches the look.,The shadow cast by the Lian Li O11 is long and glassy. No need to adjust your monitor aspect ratio or scour the ‘net for more photos: NZXT’s H9 Elite does, indeed, look like that. This ,' width of about 11.5 inches makes it look far shorter in photos than its actual 19.5-inch height. While we’ve definitely ,, it’s difficult to prepare for , of some cases unless you see them in person. This is one. In truth, 19.5 inches is only around an inch taller than an average mid-tower, but the H9 Elite has bulk and ,. The only problem: It requires some finesse and expertise to perform as good as it looks.,Looking at the empty H9 Elite from nearly any angle makes clear that its extra width went behind the motherboard tray, as a power supply mount is clearly visible through the tray’s CPU cooler bracket access hole. It also shows that the case is designed for maximum component visibility from at least two sides, and that its front radiator mount is placed on the right side. That right side is full of ventilation holes, and the included intake fans have lighting rings on the back (frame) side. Please take time to take in all the details!,The tempered-glass treatment doesn’t end with the face or left side. A giant portion of the top is also clear. More on that in a minute: From this angle, we can see that the right front corner has a power switch, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, and a headphone/microphone combo jack. Dust filtration sheets are also visible through ventilation holes on the top and right-side panel.,While we’re on the topic of dust filters, a wide one covers most of the bottom panel, which is vented to fit up to three 120mm or two 140mm fans. In handy fashion, this filter slides out from under the H9 Elite’s left side.,Swinging around to the back, we see the motherboard I/O panel hole between a full-size power supply mount and a 120mm fan. Extra space above and below the motherboard area hint at a couple of the case’s cooling options. A bar-free expansion-slot panel simplifies the installation of an optional vertical graphics card adapter bracket, and a handhold near the top edge eases removal of the snap-on top panel.,The H9 Elite’s dual-chamber design becomes even more apparent when viewed from a rear/right angle: The power supply bay rests between the motherboard tray and a fully vented steel side panel.,The top, front of the right side, and bottom are all equipped to hold so-called ‘360mm” radiators, but the bottom has additional slots to hold 240mm-class units. The side-mount fans are recessed flush to the motherboard tray, while a cable-concealing panel visually divides these sections.,Behind the fully vented steel right panel are the factory intake fans, a vertical four-bay 2.5-inch drive tray, a dual-bay 3.5-inch drive cage, and a bunch of wires. Having already seen the backs of these fans in our first photo, we can now ascertain that the fans' factory-feature lighting rings on , sides. You'll see them shine from any angle and either side. ,Even though it’s recessed enough to make 25mm-thick fans mount flush with the motherboard tray, the H9 Elite still leaves a 2.5-inch gap between its removable radiator side mount and exterior side panel. A 40mm-deep recess at the bottom of this fan mount allows long radiators to clear the bottom edge, making this a great place to put 38mm-thick radiators that are up to 410mm long (hence my reluctance to call this size truly ""360mm"").,Powered by a SATA-drive power cable and partially concealed by the 2.5-inch drive tray, an included controller addresses up to six of NZXT’s proprietary RGB devices and three fans. The PWM cable of each included fan has a pass-through connection to allow a total of six fans to be powered from this hub, and an included USB 2.0 internal interface cable allows users to address this controller via NZXT’s CAM software.,Next to the RGB controller and below the power supply bay, the H9 Elite’s dual-drive 3.5-inch cage includes additional holes on its top and bottom surfaces to enable the substitution of two 2.5-inch drives.,We need to remove the top panel before we can go any farther, which is easy since it’s held in place by six ball snaps. (Notice the removable mesh filter alongside the front panel port cutouts?) FYI, side panels are secured with ball snaps at the top, hooks at the bottom, and a redundant security screw to prevent at least one corner from coming unsnapped accidentally.,With a divider separating the side fan section from the rest of the right side, the H9 Elite is designed to draw air in through the front of the right side panel, push it over the top of the motherboard tray, and exhaust it out the rear of the right side panel. Yet it’s not as though these sections are sealed: Even that divider has cable access holes.,The H9 Elite’s installed top panel tray is designed to hold three 120mm fans exclusively, so NZXT includes a second tray for those who prefer to use two 140mm fans.,The H9 Elite’s installation hardware is compartmentalized in separate tear-open baggies, which could have been less convenient had NZXT not chosen to include a resealable bag for its cable ties. All of the pieces come in a box that’s loaded into one of the 3.5-inch drive bays, though we don’t know which one because it fell out of the bay during shipping.,Front panel cables include Gen 2 and a Gen 1 USB 3 (technically 3.2, but that’s what everything is now), HD Audio, and a now-standard nine-pin FPANEL button/LED connector. The other two cables shown are the data interface and power cord for the included RGB/fan controller.,For our sample buildout, we’re using our standardized case-testing kit with its ATX motherboard option.,Our full-size components fit easily, apart from one nagging issue that this reviewer hasn’t seen ,: In what appears to be an Imperial-to-metric conversion error, none of the standoffs aligned correctly with the holes on our motherboard. Making re-alignment even more difficult is that the factory center standoff has a peg rather than threads, and that peg is snug enough in our motherboard’s center mounting hole that sliding it around to align other holes was nearly impossible. Completion , possible with a little effort and a great deal of frustration, but we’d like to recommend replacing the center standoff with the included non-stud standoff and installing all nine screws loosely to ease alignment, before tightening everything down.,The H9 Elite is designed with a specific flow path that would be partially disrupted by any gap at the end of our mounted radiator: Rather than try out a new 3x120mm radiator and test three other cases with it to gather new comparison data, we simply blocked off the gap with a piece of black cardboard.,Lit up in our component set’s closest approximation to white, the H9 Elite provides maximum component visibility.,Even though we tried to prevent airflow reversion around the end of our radiator by plugging the gap, the H9 Elite still shows its effect in CPU temperature. Perhaps the intake fans were drawing heat from the adjacent chamber via all those gaps and access holes?,Voltage regulator temperature is mid-pack, which indicates sufficient airflow over the upper half of the motherboard.,Graphics card temperature is roughly tied for third place, but the distances among these results are small enough that we’d disregard them in a real-world buying scenario.,We always test with all fans at full speed and major components at full load, but the H9 Elite’s side fans had a greater impact on its noise level than the fans of any other case in this lot. This is the most likely reason for it to be both the quietest when observed from the left-front corner and the noisiest when observed from the right-front corner. Real-world observation matched the numbers: To my ears, it really was this good…and this bad.,Since we always recommend setting thermal fan control in real-world builds, the high noise level from one side could have been acceptable had the H9 Elite ran cool. We’re instead left bouncing around ideas about how fan placement could be used to fix the heat problem, such as mounting our radiator on the side and putting the H9 Elite’s stock fans on top, or mounting the factory fans on the bottom as intakes. ,We’re certain that some users with advanced cooling systems in mind will take advantage of all mounting locations in a way that prevents waste heat from being sucked back into the CPU’s radiator. But ordinary builders should expect nothing exceptional from the H9 Elite apart from its brilliant appearance.,NZXT's H9 Elite PC case is a stunner in person, but anyone who can't figure out an advanced fan configuration to keep their components cool shouldn't expect performance that matches the look.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Nons SL660 Review,"This instant camera works with Canon SLR lenses,Images, and the devices that capture them, are my focus. I've covered cameras at PCMag for the past 10 years, which has given me a front row seat for the DSLR to mirrorless transition, the smartphone camera revolution, and the mainstream adoption of drones for aerial imaging. You can find me on Instagram ,.,The Nons SL660 instant camera brings the blurred-background look to Instax Square film thanks to support for interchangeable lenses.,The Nons SL660 ($599, body only) is a , in the , world: It's one of a handful of models you can buy new today that works with interchangeable lenses and uses easy-to-find Fujifilm Instax Square film packs so you can pick between color or black-and-white photography. It has plenty of artistic street cred thanks to support for external flashes and multiple exposures, and is sure to satisfy creatives who are into instant film. The SL660 is more expensive than many instant cameras, but is worth the cost if you're looking for an model that will let you swap glass.,The SL660 is one of three instant SLRs in the Nons catalog, but the only one to use Instax Square film. Its other cameras, the older SL42 ($399) and forthcoming, similarly minded SL645 ($539) use Instax Mini film instead. The difference between the two is frame width—Instax Mini is about 1.8 by 2.4 inches in size, versus 2.4-by-2.4 inches for Square.,Oversized instant film calls for a chunky camera, however. The SL660 fits the bill for certain, coming in at 5.2 by 5.3 by 3.6 inches without a lens attached. It's a weighty camera too, about 1.9 pounds. Material choice comes into play here—Nons opts for machined aluminum for the body rather than plastic, so you get a heavier, but more durable build.,The industrial design does border on brutalist, though. There aren't too many rounded edges on the SL660; instead, there are more harsh angles, for a generally boxy look. A natural wood grip is affixed to the front and does improve handheld comfort, but it's a little undersized for my taste. You should definitely use the included braided strap or bring one of your own—attachment lugs are on the left side.,Speaking of the side, with square format film it doesn't really , if you hold the camera in landscape or portrait orientation. But if you want the thicker ""bottom"" border of your prints to be at the bottom you'll need to hold the camera in portrait orientation, with the grip positioned toward the sky.,The SL660 doesn't offer automatic exposure, but includes an ambient light meter and on-camera display to help you get the right brightness for your photos. The meter displays a recommended f-stop to use based on the selected shutter speed. The SL660 supports exposures from 1-second down to 1/250-second in full-stop increments and also has a Bulb setting if you want to go longer than a second.,The ambient meter does a fine job in evenly-lit situations. It's less useful when working in mixed light, like when you're framing up a shot against a strong backlight. For those situations, I reached to my iPhone and opened up the , app to check exposures. Instax Square film has a native ISO 800, but you'll want to set any external meter to ISO 200 to get a proper exposure. The camera includes enlarging optics that allow 35mm lenses to cover medium format-sized Instax Square film, and they cut two stops of light.,The shutter release is on the front and is easy to reach with your index finger. Nons fits the camera with a concave soft release button, but you can remove it to attach a remote release cable for long exposure tripod work or change it to a different soft release button if you prefer another style. I'll note that it's very easy for a soft release to work its way loose; I've lost a few over the years, including the one that came with the Nons SL660. It slipped off the camera during a walk and I didn't notice until I got home—thankfully, it's easy enough to get a ,.,For the most part, the SL660 handles like any other manual focus SLR. You'll need to set the aperture on the lens if a control ring is available. The mirror is an old style without an auto-return, so the viewfinder goes dark after you take a photo. You'll need to remember to ratchet down the lever to the left of the lens to reset the mirror for the next photo. It's not too hard to forget, as the camera makes a loud ""THUNK"" when you take a photo. You can hear it across the room.,The film compartment door takes up most of the real estate on the rear. The USB-C charging port is also on the back, and the internal battery lasts for about ten packs of film, or 100 photos. An On/Off switch is nearby, along with the unmarked button to eject film. Since the film ejection is manual, it's easy to make multi-exposure images—just take two (or more) snaps on the same frame before holding the eject button.,The SL660 works with , lenses. The SLR mount is passive, which means there's no aperture control on most lenses, and only manual focus is supported. The EF mount is fairly adaptable, so you can also use Contax-Yahica, Nikon F, M42, or Pentax K lenses along with an adapter.,Nons sent us adapters for Nikon and Pentax lenses to try with the camera. I tried the camera with a few old favorite lenses, including a Nikkor 50mm F1.4 AI-s and the SMC Pentax 31mm Limited for interior snaps with defocused backgrounds.,The , came in handy for more artistic shots outdoors, though I forgot to bring an ND filter along and found myself limited to using it at smaller apertures for outdoor snaps. The 1/250-second shutter speed is a little limiting when it comes to using the camera in bright light without the addition of a light-reducing filter, at least if you want to get photos with blurred backgrounds.,I also tried the Nons 35mm F2.4 lens. It's available in a kit with the camera for $709 and while it's an EF lens, it uses a manual aperture ring so you can adjust its f-stop. The lens is mechanically and optically sound, with construction quality that mirrors the camera, and it manages sharp, good-looking photos. I didn't try the Nons 50mm F1.8 ($649 with the camera) but would expect a similar experience.,I noticed a vignette with some lenses, which is expected. Nons says that its enlarging optics work best for lenses in the 28-58mm focal range and that longer lenses may show a hard square vignette. For me, the Nikkor 50mm was the clearest culprit, which isn't too surprising given its age and aperture. The Nons 35mm F2.4 didn't show a vignette, which makes sense as it is made for use with this camera.,If there's a reason for shutterbugs , to get the SL660, it's the viewfinder. Nons opted to go with a standard 3:2 aspect ratio focusing screen here, chopping off the sides (or top and bottom) of what the lens sees, depending on how you hold the camera. The experience is a little disorienting to photogs who are used to viewfinders with perfect framing accuracy.,Apart from framing accuracy, the optical finder is more than adequate. I was able to dial in focus readily with a 50mm F1.4 at wide aperture with middle-aged eyes. The matte focus screen skips a split-image, micro-prism collar, and other classic focus aids, but is capable of good results even without them.,If you're a photo expert you may be wondering just how Nons managed to get a viewfinder that shows a proper view from the lens, when you consider that its optics are going through an enlarging element before they get to the film. Nons added a separate focal reducer for the viewfinder optics. Even though you don't see the full square-format frame, you do get an accurate view of frame width or height, again, depending on camera orientation.,You've got to hand it to Nons for coming out of nowhere and filling a gap in the market that mainstream camera companies have largely ignored. Instant film remains hugely popular, but many of the new cameras that take it are basic models with plastic lenses. Nons hit Kickstarter with the SL42 in 2020 and the Shenzhen startup has followed its crowdfunding success with the SL660.,The swap from the SL42's Instax Mini film to the SL660's Square format is a welcome one. The roomier print size is a good thing, and you can't discount the nostalgic factor you get from square format instants. The creative options you get from changeable lenses are an obvious benefit.,There's something to be said for process, too—for some, the experience of using the camera matters. Fans of manual cameras will smile a little bit when hearing the loud thunk when pressing the shutter. None of it would matter without great-looking pictures. The SL660 is a winner there, especially when you match it up with a good lens.,We recognize that the process isn't a good match for everyone. Smartphone photogs and mirrorless camera owners may not love the manual aspects. You can pick up an , or , format printer if you just want to turn your digital photos into fridge-friendly glossy prints.,But if you love to tinker with mechanical cameras and crave the moment a scene pops into focus in the viewfinder, the SL660 is worth its salt. There are a couple of quirks for sure, but even so, we happily recommend the Nons SL660 to creatives fueled by an analog spark. It's a rewarding photographic tool, and a great camera to get if want to use your old favorite SLR lenses with instant film.,The Nons SL660 instant camera brings the blurred-background look to Instax Square film thanks to support for interchangeable lenses.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Review,"Near pro-level video editing for serious amateurs,PC hardware is nice, but it’s not much use without innovative software. I’ve been reviewing software for PCMag since 2008, and I still get a kick out of seeing what's new in video and photo editing software, and how operating systems change over time. I was privileged to byline the cover story of the last print issue of ,, the Windows 7 review, and I’ve witnessed every Microsoft win and misstep up to the latest Windows 11.,Pinnacle Studio Ultimate is a fast, full-featured, near-pro-level video editing application without a steep learning curve. Performance upgrades and new mask motion tracking, titling, and audio tools make more appealing than ever.,Pinnacle Studio Ultimate, now in its 26th version, is a video editing application that's steadily become speedier and more powerful with each iteration. Pinnacle is aimed at near-professional enthusiasts, featuring excellent editing features and effects such as stop-motion video, multicam editing, and motion tracking. The company behind the software, Alludo (formerly Corel, which continues to use Corel in some brand names), also makes the consumer-grade VideoStudio. Thankfully, Pinnacle lacks the steep learning curve associated with pro ,, though in terms of performance and usability, it still lags behind our Editors' Choice winners, , and ,.,The latest version focuses on stability and performance. According to documentation, the company has ""upgraded the structure of the product with changes in everything from behavioral logic to resource management, to a brand-new proxy codec."" As for performance, speeds affect ""launch time, resource utilization, interface and project preview responsiveness, as well as import and export speed."" The user interface has been tweaked for efficiency and the control panels offer more control over things like system resource usage.,Pinnacle Studio is available at two levels with the entry-level Pinnacle Studio listing for $59.99, and Ultimate (reviewed here) for $129.99. An Ultimate Bundle option adds loads of content and effects, plus membership in Pinnacle's Studio Backlot online community, which provides training, support, and stock content. Prices are for perpetual licenses, with no recurring subscription fee. Upgraders from previous versions of Ultimate save $40 off the full price.,If you need to edit 360-degree or 4K content, you need to spring for Ultimate, which also adds color grading, video masking, and high-end effects from NewBlue, along with unlimited video tracks. It's the only level that includes some of the new features detailed here. New since our last update of this review is a free 15-day trial version of Pinnacle Studio. Competitors, including , and CyberLink PowerDirector, also offer free trials.,The prices are in-line with the competition. For example, you pay close to the same amount ($139.99) for CyberLink PowerDirector Ultimate, $99 for the less-pro-level Adobe Premiere Elements, and $99.99 for Corel VideoStudio Ultimate. Pro-level competitors cost more, with , at $295, , at $299, and , at $239.88 (annual subscription).,Windows 10 (64-bit) or Windows 11 is required to run Pinnacle Studio, and you need an Intel Core i3 or AMD A4 3.0 GHz or higher, an Intel Core i7 4th generation or later or AMD Athlon A10 or higher for UHD, multicam, or 360 video. The software requires at least 4GB RAM, with 8GB recommended. Note that there's no macOS version.,To get going you first download a small installer stub app, which then downloads the massive full program. It's more than 2GB and takes up 3.5GB on disk after installation, so you want a fast internet connection and plenty of space on your hard drive. Of course, if you're editing 4K video, you need a big disk anyway. The installer also installs separate MultiCam Capture Lite, MyDVD, and several content packs—which can add several GB more—if you choose the full installation.,When you first run the program, you're invited to the program's User Experience Improvement Program, which sends anonymous usage data back to the company; turning it off is straightforward if you don't want it. Next, a dialog tells you that the Import feature lets you record and open media files.,Import takes up the full program window, which makes it easy to pick the types of importing you need, whether it's from DVD, computer folders, stop-motion, snapshot, or multicam. The software can import 4K content, and you can star-rate and keyword-tag content at import, which helps you find it later. The search bar also helps you find content you haven't marked in this way, searching instead for words in the filename.,One option on the Import mode is MultiCam Capture, which opens an external app that lets you record your screen along with any webcams you have connected or built into your PC. You can use function keys to start and stop recording, and the tool produces separate, synced clips that you can add to your project bin. It lets you adjust lighting and sound sources, and in my testing, it worked flawlessly.,Pinnacle's editing interface is pleasing and flexible. It sports flat, 2D icons, and a black and gray color scheme. The program uses the concept of Project Bins, in which you stash all the content for a given movie project—clips, photos, and sound files, but not effects and transitions. This approach is common for pro-level apps such as ,, and it's a feature that Alludo's other line, VideoStudio, does not include.,The whole program window is topped by four mode-switching buttons: a Home icon, Import, Edit, and Export. The first is simply a Welcome screen offering tutorials (including the excellent Studio Backlot videos), info on new program features, and additional assets and programs for sale. One thing I miss on this page is quick access to projects you're working on, something most competitors include on their welcome screens.,Edit mode uses the standard three-pane editor interface, with source content occupying the top-left quadrant of the screen, the preview window at the top right, and the timeline across the bottom half. If you're used to having preview on the left, a handy switcher button lets you move it there without any fuss. The Ultimate level allows an unlimited number of tracks, as mentioned earlier. The Plus level limits you to 24 tracks, and Standard to six. You can change the relative size of the panels, add a source-video preview, and switch the movie preview to full screen.,Interface panels can be pulled off and you can change their positions, as you can in some other editors, such as ,. The preview window includes detailed controls, such as jog and shuttle, frame advance, and rewind. You can also switch the preview between source and timeline. You expand and contract the timeline (either the main one or the one in the preview window) with a clever mouse-drag action, but I wish there were a mouse wheel option for resizing the timeline.,Searching and sorting are available for any content, which is more than I can say for some video editing programs, such as Studio's sister application, VideoStudio. Hiding and showing items by content type—video, audio, photo, and project—is simplicity itself. There's an enormous and customizable assortment of keyboard shortcuts. A helpful Project Notes panel, to help you keep track of work progress (Vegas Pro's similar feature goes a step further by attaching notes to particular timecodes). You can also choose which buttons you want to display on the timeline toolbar, including Split, Add Marker, Trim Mode, Multi-Cam Editor, and Audio Ducking.,The interface makes no specific concession to touch input, which I find useful for scrubbing, changing value sliders, and tapping control buttons. That said, scrubbing the timeline by finger did work acceptably. The software now fully supports high-resolution monitors. Rather than integrated help, you get an online PDF (it's still better than Adobe's unimpressive web help, which shows info for other products and from non-staff users). In general, however, Pinnacle's interface is more accessible than those of some competing video editors.,Pinnacle uses a magnetic timeline, so any clip you drag and drop into it snaps to any existing clips, and you can turn off that behavior if you prefer. Dropping one clip inside another splits the original one, and a razor icon offers clip splitting, as well. One thing missing is a button to drop a selected clip into the timeline at the current insertion point—most editors have it.,The Trim Mode button (or just double-clicking a join point) opens a second preview window so you can see the first and second clips' states at the trim point. It's supposed to help with effecting slip and slide trims, but I find it less intuitive than the trimming windows of CyberLink PowerDirector and VideoStudio, among other apps.,Three- and four-point editing offer more in- and out-point precision. You switch into this editing mode from the same button on the right side that switches among Smart Editing, Insert, Replace, and Overwrite modes. With the three-point option, you specify in and out points on the timeline, and an in or out point in the source clip. This way, when you insert the clip onto the timeline it will be fit to your specification.,Two insertion buttons appear on the source window: Keep Speed and Fit to Duration. The second of these stretches the source clip to fit the target area in the timeline. The four-point option lets you specify in and out points on both the source and the timeline. If your source selection is longer than the spot on the timeline you've marked, you see a dialog asking whether you want to align the source clip with the beginning or end of the timeline points, and whether to trim the source or overwrite the timeline.,If you choose the Fit to Duration button, your source clip is sped up or slowed down to fit the marked area in the timeline exactly. I see how these could be useful options and less haphazard than simply dragging the source onto the timeline. In particular, the time stretching to fit a marked area saves you time.,Dog-eared corners of adjacent clips let you adjust transition lengths between them. You can also enable dynamic-length transitions, or just stick with transitions of set lengths. Cross-fades are accessible right on the timeline via the transition dog ears, but the place from which you get your fancier transitions is somewhat hidden, compared with how other video editors present it. They're also not as simple to add to timeline clips, with no automatic duration option. Sometimes I dragged a transition between clips in my testing and the app didn't add anything. There is, however, a very full selection of transitions, grouped as 2D-3D, Artistic, Alpha Magic, and more.,The Seamless Transition tool implements an effect that's all the rage among amateur videographers. As , in this tutorial, you don't even need software to make seamless transitions, but software can in fact make them even smoother and more impressive. The seamless transitions in Pinnacle Studio work like any other transitions: You just drag them from the source panel down between clips. You get choices for downward, left-to-right, and upward motion between clips, along with variations for rotation during the transition. You can fine-tune the motion by placing similar areas in selection boxes.,The Morph transition lets you draw guides in the first and second videos to affect the transition. It's not quite as impressive as ,'s Flow transition, which blends jump cuts—for example, you might seamlessly cut a few words or even a sentence out of a single clip of an interview. The Pinnacle Morph transition is pretty much a crossfade that lets you add blurry motion between clips.,With the Wide-Angle Lens Correction feature, you simply double-click on a source clip and then choose that option from the top menu. There are six GoPro presets, but you can also manually adjust the geometry, making sure lines that should be straight are indeed rectilinear—an issue with GoPro's wide-angle lenses.,A Mask button right above the source panel accesses two kinds of masks: Shape masks and Panel masks. The first sort can only create one 2D effect, but Panel masks can be manipulated with 3D motion effects. You can create masks starting from a square, circle, pen, brush, text, or Magic Wand selection. The last option is tricky to get an effective mask with; it took me several tries to get one that worked. You can apply a mask per clip, rather than just per track.,By default, each time you click on the image with the Magic Wand tool enabled, it selects everything of the same color, regardless of whether it's contiguous—but now there's a Contiguous check box, which addresses that problem. You can hold down Control while selecting to add to the selection, and an Eraser tool lets you further refine the selection. Even with all these options, it's hard to select a subject that's not a single color.,Much more useful is the Paintbrush tool, with its very helpful Smart Edge option. It's best for selecting objects that aren’t all one color, such as people in colorful clothing or a vehicle. The Face option identifies where a face is and places an oval matte over it. It's useful for obscuring identities with the Mosaic option—best of all, it offers a tracking option. In my testing, it did a good job following and resizing along with face movements. The other mask types require you to edit keyframes to change their position and size.,But there are lots more functions to use with Masks: Opacity is one, which includes a feathering adjustment. You can also choose Fill, Blur, Turbulence, Cartoon, Detail Enhance, Oil Painting, Pencil Sketch, Fractal Clouds, Noise Reduction, and more. Alternatively, you can apply any of these functions to the Matte, or the unselected background. Filter options include High Pass, Low Pass, Dichroic, and Color. That last option lets you choose a color filter from a color picker.,With the program's smart object tracking, you select to create a shape mask as described above, and then tap the motion tracking button (a series of circles in an arc). This type of tracking adjusts the mask for certain objects, such as cars. I had trouble getting it to work with a skateboarder, however, and the tracking button is often grayed out because it hasn't identified a ""known object."" When you do get the tracking option, the process of creating the mask track is very slow—each frame took about a second on my test PC (see the Performance section below for its specs). Another problem (unless you just want to mask cars) is that cars in my frame were added to the mask even though I'd never selected any. The tool needs work, but I did get the tool to track a moving person's head and shoulders while keeping the background black and white.,Text masks are a fun option, also available in CyberLink PowerDirector. You get loads of font options, as well as adjustments for alignment, rotation, and positioning. Panel masks, as mentioned, can be manipulated in 3D using keyframes. They differ from regular masks in that you can only have one panel associated with a track, and you choose an Asset—that is, a clip or image—for the mask.,You can get to Pinnacle Studio's standard Motion Tracking tool by right-clicking on a track, by tapping the Motion Tracking button above the timeline, or by double-clicking on the clip in the timeline to open the Effects window. First, you mask the object you want to track; unlike the mask tracking mentioned above, this tool only lets you use a rectangle or oval for tracking. It took a few tries to get it to follow my masked biker, but the tracking worked about as well as it does with other similar tools. You can retrack if the followed object is lost. As with mask tracking, it's a slow process, taking a little under a second per frame on my test system.,The tool lets you apply Mosaic and Blur to the tracked object, which you can use to obscure faces, license plates, branded items, or naughty bits. But I didn't see an option to track with text, shapes, or even videos as some competitors can.,Like CyberLink PowerDirector, Pinnacle Studio lets you work with 360-degree video. You can either do some basic editing while maintaining the 360-degree aspect or convert the 360 to standard 2D view. I tested footage from the latter. Confusingly, you have to add the 360 clip to the timeline first and , right-click on it and choose Add as 360 or 360-to-Standard. Several of my sample 360 clips didn't play at all in the app, even though I could view them in Windows Movie Player.,When editing 360-degree content, you see two windows with two tabs, a 360-degree source and a preview window with the 2D result. You can pan around the scene either in the source window with a crosshairs control or just click and drag the mouse pointer around in the preview window to change the viewing angle.,The program did a good job of straightening out my 4K 360-degree test content in double-fish-eye format. If you want the content to remain in 360 degrees, you're limited to basic trimming, fade transitions, and titles. After adding titles, you also have to choose Add as 360, if you want that mode retained. I had trouble moving a title, which landed in the center of the video and didn't display in 360 Preview mode. Stabilization isn't an option for 360-degree video, though it's still available from the menus. Luckily, Pinnacle offers to let you continue editing the last project you were working on upon restarting.,You can create tiny planet and rabbit hole effects (above, left and right, respectively) with your 360-degree content. These are fun effects, and you can even animate things like the zoom, rotation, and even transition from tiny planet to rabbit hole or vice versa. Version 23 added freeze-frame for 360-degree footage. I confirmed it works by right-clicking at the insertion point and choosing Time Freeze and then entering the desired number of seconds in a dialog box.,Like its stablemate ,, Pinnacle Studio lets you simultaneously edit multiple clips of the same event shot at different angles. The base version allows two camera angles, Plus makes it four, and Ultimate gives you six. The tool did a good job of aligning my clips using their audio tracks, but you can also align using time codes and markers. As with all these tools, you switch among angles by tapping a clip's box in a grid. There are also boxes for switching the output track to clear and to black, which is great if you want to add B-roll later.,When you hit OK, a new clip shows up in your project, not in the timeline. I like that you can right-click and choose Edit Movie to fine-tune angle shifts in a timeline or even reopen it in the multicam switcher window. Some multicam tools, such as that in VideoStudio, simply create a new clip that's not adjustable after the fact. Note that I couldn't use an HEVC clip in this tool; I had to convert it before use.,Stop-motion is one of the most appealing types of animation, in my book. Just think back to , or more recently to , and ,The Pinnacle tool lets you control a connected camera to take shots automatically at time intervals you specify, and it can even show ghost images of your last shot so you know how to position the next one.,You can then send the captures to the timeline and adjust duration and apply any other editing. The tool now includes DSLR support, and circular guides that tell you how far to move an object to have it cross the screen in a specified period of between 0.3 and 10 seconds. Note that you need to allow Pinnacle access to your camera in Windows' privacy settings for it to work.,Pinnacle claims to offer more than 2,000 effects. That's more than anyone really needs, and many are duplicates with transitions or, worse, just goofy overlays. Pinnacle would do better to trim out the fat and combine the duplicates to make effects easier to find and use., For those who want the ultimate control, Pinnacle lets video editors time , kind of effect and adjustment with keyframes. That includes position, size, rotation, opacity, borders, corrections, filter effects, pan/zoom, transitions, and time remapping. Keyframing lets you evenly increase or decrease an effect over time. Once you've got a video project set up the way you want, you can save it as a template from the File menu. You specify which clips should become placeholders, which you can fill in subsequent projects with different clips. You can also select multiple keyframes as a group and modify them together or duplicate them., Nested Clips is a useful capability, especially for intros and outros, which you use over and over again. You nest by selecting several clips on your timeline, right-clicking, and choosing Group > Save Group as Project. It collapses all the selected clips into one, letting you edit it as a unit.,The Standard and Plus editions add some basic color adjustments, but Ultimate offers pro-level color grading. Choose the top-left panel's Editor button, choose Color, and you see four numbered options: Basic, Tone Curve, HSL Tuning, and Color Wheel. Basic offers White Balance, Tone (which includes exposure, contrast, and other lighting options), and Basic Settings (vibrance, saturation, clarity, and haze correction).,The Auto Tone and Auto White Balance options on this panel worked well for my sample clips. You can even apply the very pro-level LUTs (lookup tables) for color mapping. Pinnacle now includes 34 LUTs, letting you make your movie look like Pandora, Moonlight, or one of many black-and-white effects. You can also get LUTs from high-end video camera companies if you shoot with those. I was able to test it with a LUT in .CUBE file type, and it correctly applied a horror movie look to the clip. ,The Tone Curve tool, like Photoshop's, lets you change lighting for effects, correction, or contrast adjustments. HSL (hue, saturation, lighting) lets you change the color intensity and brightness separately for eight colors. One issue I had in testing this tool was that I couldn't see the effect until moving the play head. That's not a big deal, but it isn't ideal.,The Color interface also can display a video scope in four modes: waveform, vector, histogram, and RGB parade. Professional editors are familiar with these views of color information, though they're of less use to amateurs. You can show vectorscopes for a selected range of colors, for example, skin tones. To make it happen, you use a brush to mark the areas of your image for which you want to see the scope.,Pinnacle Studio lets you copy and paste color settings. There's no menu choice for it, but hitting Ctrl-C while the color adjustment panel was active did let me copy the settings to another clip.,The Color Wheels view lets you adjust saturation and hue separately for each of three tonal ranges: Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, as well as applying an overall color shift. It's pro-level stuff like what you find in Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro, but not in Corel VideoStudio or Adobe Premiere Elements. I appreciate that double-clicking the control points resets them to the center. You can use these tools to either fine-tune the colors or to get some crazy effects, as in the screenshot above., Many of these are standard, old-school Photoshop filters, but there are many impressive effects among them, such as Dream Glow and Old Film. Many included third-party effects, such as NewBlue's Drop Shadow, Shredder, and Photon Blast, are of professional quality. With the Ultimate edition, you get several NewBlue plug-in effects. The latest of these to make its way into the program is NewBlue Video Essentials 5, which lets you apply selective focus, selective color, and selective tint. Other NewBlue packs include several geometry-altering effects, along with good auto-contrast, gradient-tint, diffusion, and rolling-shutter effects.,Why should digital photos be the only type of content you can turn into art and enhance with artsy effects? The Paint tool in Pinnacle gives you impressive Paint effects: Stylization, Pencil Sketch, Oil Painting, Detail Enhance, and Cartoon. You're not actually painting on the image, but the effects make it look painted or drawn. I particularly like the Stylization effect, which looks like graphic novel art. The Cartoon effect uses more of a black ink outline around the object in the video. But these effects aren't as sophisticated as PowerDirector's AI Styles, which you're your video the look of specific artists, such as Van Gogh.,Pinnacle Studio includes strong tools for 3D editing. Picture-in-picture is also well supported, and Pinnacle now has templates like those in PowerDirector, and what Premiere Elements calls ""video collages."" Pinnacle Studio includes a dozen of what it calls Split Screen templates. You can drag these onto the timeline and then open a sub-editor to add clips to the PiP layout. The Split Screen Template Creator lets you draw shapes to create your very own reusable PiP layout. You can use keyframes to animate these templates.,A special tool of its own, the transparency effect is accessible from a button above the timeline. It provides an easy way to adjust each track's transparency level, in percentages. It's a useful tool for creating an evocative effect, especially for showing the passing of time. But I find PowerDirector's masking tool with automated animations more fun.,Related to transparency is the Blend Mode feature. When you place an overlay clip, you can now choose from 16 Photoshop-like blend modes, such as Color Burn, Hard Light, Dissolve, and Multiply. These let you produce artistic, unique effects based on the clips you're overlaying.,Chroma-keying worked well with my green-screen test footage, nearly perfectly removing the somewhat imperfect green background., The Stabilize tool lets you adjust borders and zoom, and you can have it work in the background, as it is time-consuming. My shaky footage came out somewhat smoothed. As with all similar tools, however, it's no substitute for in-camera stabilization or, better still, a tripod., Text is a strength for Pinnacle, and it gets even stronger with recent updates. The program offers cool things like 3D title editing such as you find in Final Cut Pro X. Titles can be positioned on three axes and you can choose the light source and angle. You also get a choice of material types for your title, such as metal or plastic. ,Keyframes can animate your titles, and the tool for it is impressive because it works down to individual words and letters. You can also use different font sizes, colors, and motion for different words and letters within a single title. Rotation is possible per individual letter and on different axes.,Both Magix Movie Edit Pro and PowerDirector have added other nifty title tricks in recent versions, including video mask title effects, though the last lacks 3D title editing. Even without the 3D options, Pinnacle offers a good choice of animated text options, all of which you can edit on-screen in WYSIWYG fashion.,. Pinnacle Studio's screen-cam capability is something you can also find in Corel VideoStudio. The tool comes as a separate application called Live Screen Capturing. Pinnacle Studio's implementation worked perfectly in my tests.,Sound for your digital movies is another strong point of Pinnacle Studio. Right from the timeline, you can display level controls; toolbar buttons take you quickly to a selection of background music and to voiceover recording options. You can even raise and lower clip volume by dragging a clip's audio line up and down, as you can in Final Cut Pro. The program supports 5.1 surround positioning including controls for Angle, Spread, and Center—all keyframeable to create panning effects.,The Scorefitter options stretch background music of various styles to fit your movie. Just drag its timeline entry to fit, and after processing some rendering, presto: instant background music! The source panel's Sound Effects tab offers a wealth of sound clips, from birdsong to strong wind to all manner of vehicles. There are also audio cleaning tools like the Speech De-esser (to remove sibilance) and a noise reducer.,Audio ducking automatically lowers background music during speech. The tool worked well in a test video, with more control than its VideoStudio counterpart. I found it easy to set the threshold for it to kick in and the amount of reduction in volume of the background music.,The audio noise removal tool is customizable and powerful. You select an area of the waveform that contains only noise, and the program creates a profile based on it, allowing targeted removal. You can then adjust the reduction, sensitivity, and smoothing. It indeed works better than generic noise removal tools I've used. Another fun tool is Pitch Scaling, which lets you raise or lower the pitch of music without affecting the speed. For example, you could make a high soprano sound like a deep bass or like a chipmunk without changing the clip length.,Unless I'm running other software simultaneously Pinnacle feels snappy when working with the timeline, though my test system is showing its age, as things got sluggish with overlays and time remapping while running other apps. I didn't run into any program stalls as I have in the past, because stability has improved. ,For rendering speed comparison, I tested by creating a movie consisting of four clips of mixed types with a standard set of transitions. I rendered it to 720p MPEG-4 at 15Mbps, H.264 High Profile. Audio was MPEG AAC Audio: 192 Kbps. I tested on a PC running 64-bit Windows 10 Pro with a 3.4GHz Core i7 6700 CPU, 16GB RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 with 4GB GDDR5 RAM. I ran the test three times and took the geometric mean (which minimizes the effect of outliers).,The test movie (which has a duration of just under 5 minutes) took Pinnacle Studio 129 seconds (2 minutes and 9 seconds), putting it in the middle of the pack. DaVinci Resolve was fastest at 39 seconds and Nero Video was slowest at 366 seconds. Pinnacle beats consumer video market leader Adobe Premiere Elements' 222 seconds by a good margin.,The program includes a full disc-authoring module with support for Blu-ray discs, along with DVD and AVCHD formats. To go this route, you click the Disc Menu Content button, which looks like a disc. A good selection of menu styles is at your disposal; you add chapter markers to taste and preview with on-screen disc controls. Next, you choose the Export to MyDVD option, which appears when you click the Export mode-switching button.,As for the more modern output method—sharing online—Pinnacle's Export dialog's Cloud selection offers direct uploading to Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Box. When I tried the first, I was thankfully able to set the privacy level before uploading, and I had a choice of video quality, from 360p to 1080p.,Like Adobe Premiere Elements, Pinnacle can now create animated GIFs from your short movies. The choice is a little bit hidden, as it's not included in the Format dropdown options. You have to change the Extension and then choose GIF. And the only way to see options like Loop Play and frame rate is to click the pencil button. To be fair, the option is no more obvious in Premiere Elements; it requires you to switch to Custom, then choose an Advanced Settings panel.,You can also simply export to disk in a wide range of file formats, including AVCHD; DivX; MKV; MPEG-1, 2, and 4; QuickTime; and WMV. Presets let you target your output format to popular viewing devices such as the iPhone and Xbox. The program lets you export to H.265 HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) format, which is important for data-hungry 4K and even 8K content since it doubles compression while maintaining image quality.,You can also batch process multiple projects—a more-or-less pro-level capability, and even Premiere Pro requires the separate Adobe Media Encoder for it. It's made possible by a simple Add to Queue option and tab in the Export page, which anyone who is producing a lot of video projects will surely appreciate.,Pinnacle Studio is an excellent video editing tool. The latest version doesn't add new editing tools, but instead focuses on performance and stability. The software impresses with its many powerful video editing capabilities and friendly interface. It's truly a near-professional-level product, with options like keyframing, tracking, and multicam. Usability and performance continue to improve, though they are still somewhat behind our Editors' Choice winners for video editing, CyberLink PowerDirector and Corel VideoStudio. We also like DaVinci Resolve, which offers a capable free version and faster exports.,Pinnacle Studio Ultimate is a fast, full-featured, near-pro-level video editing application without a steep learning curve. Performance upgrades and new mask motion tracking, titling, and audio tools make more appealing than ever.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Jumbo Review,"Free identity theft protection for everyone,When the IBM PC was new, I served as the president of the San Francisco PC User Group for three years. That’s how I met PCMag’s editorial team, who brought me on board in 1986. In the years since that fateful meeting, I’ve become PCMag’s expert on security, privacy, and identity protection, putting antivirus tools, security suites, and all kinds of security software through their paces.,While Jumbo doesn’t perform elaborate credit reporting and identity monitoring like the expensive services, it does warn of breaches and provides expert recovery help, all at no cost to you.,There are all kinds of reasons that , is expensive. The provider employs agents that give you white-glove personal help to recover from identity theft, maintains servers that handle continuous monitoring for misused personal data, and pays a third-party insurance company to back monetary guarantees. Yet Jumbo offers identity protection at no charge. How is that possible? As you’ll see, it’s partly economy of scale, partly choosing just what to monitor, and partly having other sources of income. Jumbo doesn’t offer the range of features found in the more comprehensive (and expensive) services, but it’s certainly worth a look. For now, however, , is our Editors’ Choice winner. ,Per Jumbo’s CEO Pierre Valade, a personal Jumbo subscription used to cost $99 per year, or $150 for a five-license family subscription. A fair amount of that fee went to paying the insurance company, the one that backs Jumbo’s promise to spend cash saving you from identity theft. But Jumbo also has a more lucrative business protecting the workforce for enterprise-level clients. What would happen if they made the personal subscription free?,Clearly, the company would have to eat the insurance cost. However, that cost goes down on a per-user basis as the number of insured goes up. If the free edition becomes wildly popular, the company’s cost per subscription goes way down.,Jumbo also makes each of its users a kind of ambassador. Each new user’s protection is backed by a $25,000 insurance bond to handle losses from identity theft. But each time you refer a friend who signs up for Jumbo, you get another $25,000 in insurance, up to a maximum of a million dollars. All you need to get that million in insurance is to sell your 39 closest friends on the idea of free identity theft protection.,That million-dollar guarantee is the default for all the competing products I’ve evaluated. Some offer even more. At its Plus protection level, , raises the insurance limit to two million. The Ultimate Plus edition of Norton 360 With LifeLock reserves a million for reimbursement and another million to pay lawyers as needed. However, you pay quite a bit for these services. That top-tier Bitdefender product runs $239.99 per year, while Norton’s Ultimate Plus tier goes for $349.99 per year.,The entry-level price for IDX Complete comes in higher than Norton’s top, at $355.32 per year. , and Aura are comparatively less expensive, costing $179.40 and $144 per year respectively. At the entry-level Premium tier, McAfee+ costs $139.99 per year, but you don’t get identity theft protection unless you opt for the Advanced tier, which costs $199.99 per year.,To be fair, the products I’ve noted here all combine identity theft protection with security protection for your local devices. A , subscription lets you protect every device in your household whether it runs Android, ChromeOS, iOS, macOS, or Windows. Norton subscriptions range from five devices to unlimited. IDShield bundles protection by ,, either three or 15 licenses depending on the selected tier. Jumbo sticks with protecting your identity and privacy.,The typical identity theft subscription protects just one person, even if it comes with a multi-license security suite subscription. Bitdefender just leaves it at one; if you want to protect another individual you need another subscription. McAfee used to do the same, but a new Family plan covers two adults and four children for $269.99 (Advanced) or $424.99 (Ultimate).,Norton offers the basic subscription protecting just you, a family plan for you and your partner, and a family plus kids plan that covers the two of you plus up to five children. Crossed with the three tiers of protection, that’s nine possible plans, topping out at $799.99 per year if you want Ultimate Plus protection for family and kids.,You get that same two-adult, five-kid plan from , for $701.88 per year. With IDShield, $359.40 gets a yearly subscription that covers identity protection for two adults and unlimited kids. And , plays it by the numbers, with identity protection for one, two, or five adults running $144, $264, or $444 per year. In many cases, adding more individuals for identity protection also increases the number of device-security licenses. For example, Aura’s three tiers come with 10, 20, and 50 device licenses respectively.,As for Jumbo, extending protection to your family members costs exactly nothing. After all, it’s free! But for now, you’re better off inviting family members to join as contacts, because that way each referral bumps your insurance cap by $25,000. My contact at Jumbo indicates that going forward, adding a family member will give you the same benefit as adding a contact.,When you engage the services of an identity protection company, you typically must turn over a boatload of personal information you want protected. Your SSN, your bank accounts, your birthdate, and more. Trust is a must, and for some consumers, a big name like Bitdefender, McAfee, or Norton engenders that trust.,Jumbo doesn’t remotely have the same mindshare as those big names, but , is extremely thorough. PCMag’s Max Eddy, a connoisseur of privacy policies due to his work with ,, gave it a thumbs up. He was particularly impressed by the fact that the policy listed data shared with every partner organization, things like the help desk, email provider, newsletter handler, and ISP.,Jumbo’s policy is to request and retain as little data as possible. You don’t even have to sign up for an account. In most cases, data resides strictly on your device, and data in transit is protected. For example, to check your email address against known breaches, Jumbo transmits a hash of the address, not the address itself.,As for how Jumbo protects information like your bank account or SSN, that’s easy—it doesn’t. Because it doesn’t ask for that information in the first place. That does mean that Jumbo can’t monitor your personal information the way competitors can, but some users may be just fine with that.,Starting your free Jumbo subscription is as simple as snapping a QR code on the Jumbo website or downloading the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Launching the app begins a leisurely onboarding process you can work through all at once or complete at your convenience. Note that you access the service strictly through mobile devices; there’s no web interface or desktop app.,To start, Jumbo checks known data breaches for the presence of your email address. You can review its findings right away or put that task off for later. If you come up clean, it suggests trying another email address, noting users frequently find breaches on multiple addresses. As you step through the introduction you’ll enable 24/7 monitoring, turn on Wi-Fi checking, and claim your $25,000 insurance against losses from identity theft.,Next Jumbo invites you to share your new-found protection with your friends, a step that entails giving Jumbo access to your Contacts list. When you do, it checks the email address of every contact for exposures and displays the number of data leaks next to each. Just in case you forgot, each contact has a button labeled +$25,000. Clicking the button creates an email message to share Jumbo. You can also tap to share that link via other messaging systems.,I was surprised to find the message contained nothing but a link to download Jumbo. No boilerplate text explaining what Jumbo is, not even a subject line. The message Jumbo sends when you add a family member is full of useful information and links.,If your operating system isn’t quite up to date, Jumbo prompts to take care of that problem. It also offers to block trackers, something it accomplishes using VPN technology as a local filter. You can take all the time you want to work through the onboarding process, or you can power through in one big push.,Once that initial configuration is out of the way, launching the Jumbo app opens a dashboard with a big status panel at the top. Below that, there’s a banner titled Boost your coverage—tapping it takes you to the list of contacts for sharing. Four panels below display the labels My Identity, My iPad (or My Device on Android), My Money, and My Family. A fifth, My Vault, appears only if you use the Jumbo Vault feature, which I’ll discuss below. The Settings button at the bottom rounds out the display.,Jumbo also gives you a weekly rundown of what it’s done for you. It reports any new data breaches, notes whether you encountered an insecure Wi-Fi connection, verified that your device is fully updated, and reports on blocked trackers.,Tap My Family to add protection to family members. For each addition, you identify the relationship: Children, Parents, Friends, Significant Other / Partner, or Grandchildren. At the next page you enter the person’s name and email. One more tap and Jumbo sends an email with instructions. The selection of the relationship type doesn’t seem to have any effect. In fact, Jumbo prompts you to add more family members without asking just who they are to you.,Back in your own instance of Jumbo, you can see when your family member completed the installation. Jumbo reminds you how many invitations remain; you can invite five family members, not including yourself.,As noted, Jumbo , allocates a million dollars to handle your losses due to identity theft. However, you don’t get that million without some work. Just after signing up, you get $25,000 in insurance, with another $25,000 added each time you successfully refer a friend. It would take 39 successful referrals to reach the maximum million-dollar coverage.,As you’ll see if you tap My Money and then tap View My Coverage, you get more than insurance. Like competing identity theft services, Jumbo offers 24/7 phone assistance, with ID restoration experts available to help you recover from an identity theft attack. This remediation help is really the core of an identity theft subscription. It doesn’t matter how you realized you need help. The point is that you don’t have to face recovery alone—you have the aid of experts.,I happened to install Jumbo just after the release of an iPadOS update, before my iPad updated automatically. Jumbo properly warned me to apply that update. My test Android needed an update, too. Any time there’s a new OS version available and you haven’t yet installed it, Jumbo points out the problem. Each time you connect to a Wi-Fi network, it checks to make sure the connection is properly encrypted and warns you if not. I found that it doesn’t check the network you’re already using; I had to disconnect and reconnect to get an initial scan. I’m told that will be fixed shortly.,Jumbo also uses its local VPN filter to strip out advertisers and other trackers. It doesn’t use a browser extension the way some tracking blockers do, so there’s no visual reminder of trackers blocked on a given website. However, you can dig in at any time to see recent detections or get an all-time list.,Finally, we get to the core of Jumbo’s purpose, identity protection. Tapping the My Identity panel gets you a lengthy scrolling list of items. At the top, there’s a statistic showing how many total data leaks Jumbo found in your contact list, with a button to open that list and perhaps invite them to use Jumbo. Below that you see any new data leaks for your own email addresses, with a button to connect another address for tracking. These are items that you probably initialized during the onboarding process.,As you scroll down, though, more items come into view. Jumbo offers to protect your LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook accounts from “being used for ads, tracking, and third-party sharing."" It also offers to intercede with Alexa, forcing her to stop saving your voice recordings. For Twitter and Facebook Messenger, Jumbo can automate the deletion of old tweets and conversations, so they don’t hang around forever. Finally, it helps you view and control what information Google keeps about you.,In every case, getting these additional identity protections requires that you log in to the service in question from within Jumbo, a standard requirement for such services. A banner across the bottom proclaims, “Your data never leaves your phone without your consent. Jumbo never sells your data.” Note, too, that a link at the top of every connected service lets you quickly cut the connection.,In the process of exploring Jumbo’s screens, I encountered and used quite a few of its features. Checking an email account was easy, and Jumbo encouraged me to add any other accounts I use. The one area not covered by the onboarding process is Jumbo’s collection of social media privacy features.,Privacy recommendations for LinkedIn seemed logical and useful. Several related to cutting off standard ways LinkedIn shares your data and presents advertisements. If you want to prevent people from finding your LinkedIn page using your email or phone number, just click to have Jumbo take care of it; if you , to be found, you can click to ignore the recommendation. You can opt out of giving people notifications when you view their profiles (which also turns off those notifications for you). Don’t want to reveal when you’re online? A click does it.,It takes more than a click to enable ,, but Jumbo strongly recommends it. Clicking to protect your account takes you directly to LinkedIn’s multi-factor page, where you must enter your password again. But that’s all you do. Jumbo becomes your authentication app, displaying the time-sensitive six-digit code in its Vault (more about the Vault shortly).,Jumbo’s advice and choices for Instagram proved very different, naturally. If your aim is to be an Insta influencer, you want all the connections you can get, but ordinary folks may want to turn off reshares. Jumbo also makes it easy to take charge when people post “photos of you,” and lets you turn off visible online status.,Yes, these are all things you could do by logging into Instagram and finding the right setting. Jumbo also offers to archive your old posts, on the basis that really old posts may not reflect your current thinking. You specify what you mean by “old” (the default is six months) and decide whether you want to keep a copy.,By default, your copies go to the Jumbo Vault, though iOS users get the option to save to iCloud or DropBox. Whatever you choose, Jumbo periodically archives all posts older than the cutoff you specified. Note that you can’t restore archived posts back into Instagram.,You can archive old tweets and Facebook posts, too. The Jumbo Vault appears in your dashboard only after you’ve put something into it.,Connecting with Facebook revealed a daunting set of options and recommendations. Five toggles at the top offer to delete searches, block advertisers, archive posts, enable multi-factor authentication, and delete old Messenger conversations.,More than a dozen recommendations below overlap the five Facebook toggles, in a somewhat confusing way. For example, four distinct items advise you to prevent ad targeting based on your employer, job title, relationship status, and education. Would toggling Block Advertisers take care of these? When I asked about my confusion in this area, my Jumbo contact explained that it’s very hard to keep up with Facebook and that Jumbo would likely drop it in a future update.,Under Twitter, things are simpler. You can archive your tweets, as with Instagram and Facebook posts. You can turn off letting people find your Twitter account using your phone number or email. And you can enable two-factor authentication with just a click, making Jumbo your ,.,You may not know that Amazon’s Alexa retains voice recordings of your queries. If that sounds creepy, Jumbo can have Alexa delete those for you, and also enable multi-factor authentication.,As for Google, the original sees-all, knows-all Panopticon, Jumbo offers a big package of deletions. You can delete Searches, Gmail Searches, YouTube Searches, Chrome Device History, Google Map Activities, and Location History. Jumbo also offers to take on multi-factor authentication for Google.,If you seriously work through Jumbo’s social media recommendations, you’ll improve your privacy. Yes, many of the items are things you could do manually, if only you knew where to find the settings. But Jumbo also makes it very easy to archive your too-old posts and set up multi-factor authentication.,I mentioned earlier that Jumbo doesn’t request the vast amounts of personal information required by most identity theft services. Naturally, it also doesn’t monitor that information like the others. All the products I’ve reviewed watch for misuse of your SSN. Aura tracks attempts to meddle with your home title, as does Norton (at its top protection level). Many of them keep an eye out for criminal proceedings where the perp used your data.,Many of the services notify you of anomalous bank or credit card transactions. Of course, they can only do that because you gave them full access to the account. Some also watch for new accounts opened using your information.,You can get a , from each of the three big agencies once per year, with no need for an identity protection service. At the time of this writing, the agencies are offering weekly reports, but that could end, as the policy is related to COVID. Identity protection services typically partner with one of the agencies to offer credit reports monthly or, at higher tiers, daily. Jumbo doesn’t get between you and the agencies. In any case, you can get real-time credit tracking and alerts from free services such as ,.,Identity protection from Bitdefender, McAfee, or Norton comes with the company’s , for local device protection. IDShield bundles Trend Micro’s suite. IDX Complete is not a suite but does have a VPN, password manager, and more. Aura builds in antivirus protection along with a very simple VPN and password manager.,As for Jumbo, it’s strictly devoted to identity protection. But since it’s free, you might logically pair it with a free antivirus or security suite. Our Editors’ Choice in that realm is ,, a slightly diminished free version of the massive Avast One suite.,Most identity theft solutions require you to trust them with vast amounts of personal information, which they then promise to monitor and protect. Jumbo takes the absolute minimum of personal data, just your email address (or addresses), and aims to keep data on your device rather than in its servers. Either way, if identity thieves attack, you get 24/7 support and access to trained recovery experts. Yes, the commercial products back their recovery efforts with a million-dollar guarantee, but a dedicated Jumbo aficionado can theoretically reach that same level of insurance by signing up friends. Some people avoid identity theft products because they’re intrusive, others because they’re expensive. If you fit either profile, consider giving Jumbo a try. Even so, Norton 360 With LifeLock remains our Editors’ Choice winner in the identity protection arena—it’s not cheap, but you get your money’s worth.,While Jumbo doesn’t perform elaborate credit reporting and identity monitoring like the expensive services, it does warn of breaches and provides expert recovery help, all at no cost to you.,Sign up for , newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Kingston Fury Renegade SSD Review,"A speedy, cost-effective way to join the rebellion,Since 2004, I have worked on PCMag’s hardware team, covering at various times printers, scanners, projectors, storage, and monitors. I currently focus my testing efforts on 3D printers, pro and productivity displays, and drives and SSDs of all sorts. ,The Kingston Fury Renegade SSD offers good value in a PCI Express 4 high-performance gaming SSD, with benchmark scores that were solid, though out of the top tier.,The Kingston Fury Renegade SSD (starts at $84.99 for the 500GB version; $226.99 for 2TB as tested) offers solid performance and good value for a PCI Express 4.0 NVMe ,. Although it didn't crack the top tier among the elite speedsters we compared it with, the Fury Renegade turned in respectable scores in both our gaming and general storage benchmarks. Our review unit comes with a heat sink, though you can get it without one for $5 less. It comes in capacities up to 4TB, although the 1TB and 2TB versions are the most cost-effective per gigabyte, offering excellent value compared with some slightly more capable gaming SSDs like the ,.,The Fury Renegade is built on an , (80mm long) ""gumstick"" printed circuit board and uses the ,. It combines Micron 176-layer TLC NAND flash memory with the Phison E18 controller that we've seen on many high-performance PCI Express 4 drives. (Unfamiliar with M.2 and PCIe jargon? Check out our ,.),The Fury Renegade SSD that we tested comes with a full heat sink, with list prices for the different capacities given in the table below. The standard version of the drive, equipped with a graphite-aluminum heat spreader, sells for about $5 less for a given capacity. With a height of 10.5mm, the heat sink-equipped Fury Renegade can be squeezed into a , open M.2 slot with,.,Price-wise, in terms of cost per gigabyte, the Fury Renegade's sweet spot is the 1TB and (especially) the 2TB models. And as is frequently case with the growing number of drives that come in capacities up to 4TB, you do pay a premium per gigabyte for that extra 2TB capacity at the high end.,The Fury Renegade's durability ratings (expressed in terms of lifetime write capacity in total terabytes written or TBW) are at the high end of PCIe 4.0 speedsters we have tested. The Crucial P5 Plus and the , and , offer more typical ratings for TLC NAND-based SSDs, at 600TBW and 1,200TBW for 1TB and 2TB respectively; the MLC-based Samsung SSD 990 Pro has the same durability ratings. A few PCI Express 4.0 drives offer substantially higher durability ratings; the ,, for example, is rated at 1,600TBW for 1TB and 3,300TBW for 2TB. At the other extreme, the Mushkin Delta, which uses less durable QLC memory, is rated at just 200TBW for 1TB, 400TBW for 2TB, and 800TBW for 4TB.,The ""terabytes written"" spec is a manufacturer's estimate of how much data can be written to a drive before some cells begin to fail and get taken out of service. (TBW usually scales 1:1 with capacity, and that's true with the Fury Renegade.) Kingston's warranty for the drive is good for five years or until you hit the rated TBW figure in data writes, whichever comes first.,Within the drive's box you'll find a download code for Acronis True Image HD cloning software. One feature the Fury Renegade lacks is 256-bit AES hardware-based encryption, though it is less important on a gaming-centric SSD than a drive for creators or businesspeople.,We test PCI Express 4.0 internal SSDs using a desktop testbed with an MSI X570 motherboard and AMD Ryzen CPU, 16GB of Corsair Dominator DDR4 memory clocked to 3,600MHz, and a discrete graphics card. We tested the Fury Renegade using its own pre-attached heat sink, rather than the one on our testbed.,We put the Fury Renegade through our usual internal SSD benchmarks, comprising Crystal DiskMark 6.0, PCMark 10 Storage, and a relatively new test, UL's 3DMark Storage Benchmark, which measures a drive's performance in a number of gaming-related tasks, presenting a single aggregate score. Crystal DiskMark's sequential speed tests provide a traditional measure of drive throughput, simulating best-case, straight-line transfers of large files.,The Fury Renegade effectively matched its sequential read and write speed ratings, in each case coming within 100MBps of its rated speed. Many of the PCI Express 4 speedsters with which we compare it have similar rated and tested speeds. Curiously, although it edged out the SK Hynix Platinum P41 and , for the highest sequential write score in our comparison group, its sequential read speed was the lowest of the group. Still, speed differences (primarily in write speeds) aside, these elite drives are endowed with blazing throughput compared with midrange PCIe 4 SSDs, let alone PCI Express 3 drives.,The PCMark 10 Overall Storage test measures a drive's speed in performing a variety of routine tasks such as launching Windows, loading games and creative applications, and copying both small and large files. The Fury Renegade's Overall score was in the middle of the pack, well short of the SK Hynix Platinum P41 and Samsung SSD Pro 990. ,While the PCMark 10 Overall Storage score aggregates the results of multiple tasks, you can also see the scores for its individual trace-based tests. The Fury Renegade's gaming-test traces were a mixed bag: While its Call of Duty Black Ops 4 score was the third best, after the WD SN850X and SK Hynix P41, its trace score for Battlefield 5 was third from the bottom, and its Overwatch score was in the middle. Its Windows booting and Adobe program launching scores were middling. Its copy-test results were good: second best for ISO Copy and third best for File Copy. ,The relatively new 3DMark Storage test measures times for installation, loading, playing (while recording a gameplay video), saving, and/or copying a Steam folder of various AAA games including Battlefield V, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, Overwatch, The Outer Worlds, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The Fury Renegade's score was in the middle of the pack, well under the WD SN850X but easily besting the ,.,With a name like the Kingston Fury Renegade SSD, we were hoping for a totally badass frag-happy product. But although it's by no means slouchy, it lagged our top performers, particularly the WD SN850X and SK Hynix P41, in nearly all of our benchmarks. That said, its benchmark scores were solid, and it's a very capable drive. It's also cost-effective at the 1TB and 2TB levels, and with above-par durability. The heat sink-equipped version we tested costs only about $5 more than the standard drive—which is equipped with a graphene-aluminum heat spreader—at each of its capacities, which max out at 4TB.,Still, several other drives offer better gaming and overall performance based on our testing. We were wowed by the SK Hynix Platinum P41, which came out of nowhere—it's the company's first PCI Express 4.0 ,—to easily surpass its sequential read and write scores and set new high scores right and left in our general and gaming-specific storage benchmarks. ,The WD Black SN850X proved an excellent upgrade to the SN850, besting the P41 in several benchmarks, including blowing away the P41 in the 3DMark Storage gaming test by a wide margin. Although the Fury Renegade fell short of both of these drives in most of our benchmarks, it's much more cost-effective and thus an excellent value. If total game domination is paramount for you, the P41 and SN850X might be better choices, but the Fury Renegade is a good value with much to recommend it.,The Kingston Fury Renegade SSD offers good value in a PCI Express 4 high-performance gaming SSD, with benchmark scores that were solid, though out of the top tier.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

HP EliteBook 840 G9 Review,"A strong, state-of-the-art business laptop in a tough, tough field,I was picked to write the ""20 Most Influential PCs"" feature for PCMag's 40th Anniversary coverage because I remember them all—I started on a TRS-80 magazine in 1982 and served as editor of , when it was a 700-page monthly. I was later the editor in chief of ,, a magazine that promoted using tech to work from home two decades before a pandemic made it standard practice. Even in semiretirement in Bradenton, Florida, I can't stop playing with toys and telling people what gear to buy.,With nearly all modern conveniences—including Wi-Fi 6E, 5G, and first-rate security—HP's EliteBook 840 G9 is an excellent corporate traveler...but not quite exemplary.,Setting aside its ZBook , and ultralight Dragonfly line, HP's EliteBook 800 models are the firm's second-best , (between the 600 and 1000 series). The EliteBook 840 G9 (starts at $1,129; $1,609 as tested) sits smack in the mainstream of 14-inch, clamshell corporate notebooks. This laptop is packed with up-to-date features like a slightly taller 16:10 (instead of 16:9) aspect ratio display, ,, and 5G mobile broadband. HP's 840 G9 doesn't upstage Lenovo's legendary , as our favorite business laptop, but it's a trim and terrific enterprise option.,On HP.com, the cheapest EliteBook 840 G9 is $1,129 with a 12th Generation Intel Core i5 ,, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB NVMe solid-state drive. Four screen choices are available, all IPS panels with 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution: non-touch or touch with a modest 250 nits of brightness, a sunnier 400-nit non-touch screen, and one of HP's Sure View Reflect panels with an integrated privacy filter. Disappointingly, you can't get a sharper 4K or , display.,For $1,609, our , Pro test unit steps up to a faster Core i7-1280P chip (six Performance cores, eight Efficient cores, 20 threads) with Intel's vPro IT manageability tech, a 512GB SSD, and Intel 5G Solution 5000 connectivity for desolate places without Wi-Fi coverage. Extras include a SmartCard slot as well as both a fingerprint reader and face-recognition webcam to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello. The laptop also features HP's Wolf Security bundle, including BIOS and AI-based malware protection along with Sure Click sandboxing of online apps and websites.,This aluminum-clad EliteBook measures 0.76 by 12.4 by 8.8 inches, and it just clears our , cutoff at 2.99 pounds. Among other 14-inch business systems with 16:10 screen aspect ratios, Lenovo's X1 Carbon is an eighth of an inch thinner and half a pound lighter (2.48 pounds), while the , is lighter still at 2.2 pounds.,Thin bezels border the sides of the screen, with slightly thicker bars above and below. A sliding shutter covers the webcam lens when you want some privacy, and a microphone mute key is included on the top row. Ports include two , ports with , support on the left flank, along with an HDMI monitor port. The laptop features one 5Gbps USB 3.2 Type-A port on each side plus an audio jack, a nano SIM slot, and a security-cable lockdown notch on the right. HP's compact AC adapter has a USB-C connector.,Beyond even the recently growing 1080p standard, HP's webcam captures up to 2,560-by-1,440-pixel (16:9 aspect ratio) or 2,560-by-1,920-pixel (4:3) stills, as well as 1080p or 1440p videos. Images produced by the camera are reasonably well-lit and colorful, with minimal static. The myHP utility's HP Presence enhancements include a backlight and low-light adjustment, as well as framing tools for your head, head and shoulders, or upper body—depending on how much of your shirt or blouse you want to show.,Speaking of shirts, what appears in my reviews more often than torn bodices do in romance novels? Complaints about HP laptops arranging the cursor arrow keys in a clumsy row instead of the handier inverted-T layout. The EliteBook's arrow keys are only half-size but are—amazingly—properly placed.,Even better are the dedicated Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys in a ThinkPad-style arrangement at the top right for the first two and lower right for the latter. The backlit keyboard has a shallow but reasonably snappy typing feel, and typing on it is audible but not too noisy. The laptop's decently sized, buttonless touchpad glides and clicks smoothly.,Sound from the bottom-firing speakers isn't exactly symphonic, but it's loud and sharp enough for any business use, as well as for enjoying streaming movies or music. These speakers produce very little bass to speak of, but the audio isn't harsh or tinny even at top volume, and it's easy to make out overlapping tracks. HP Audio Control software provides music, movie, and voice modes, as well as an equalizer. Finally, AI-based speaker and mic noise reduction, and sound calibration for supported headsets, are also available here.,I'm sad that the EliteBook doesn't match most rivals in supporting a high-res screen option, but the 1,920-by-1,200 display is perfectly crisp and quite bright. Colors are rich and well-saturated, contrast is decent, and viewing angles are wide. White backgrounds are clean, helped by the ability to tilt the screen back as far as you like, and I can't see any pixelation around the edges of letters on websites and in emails.,For our benchmark charts, we're comparing the HP to four other 14-inch slimline laptops, including the premium Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 (starts at $1,439; $2,249 as tested) and the more affordable , (starts at $1,299.99; $1,499.99 as tested). The , (starts at $2,169; $2,994 as tested) is a business convertible, while the , (starts at $1,249; $2,070 as tested) is a consumer showpiece with a 4K OLED display.,Our primary performance benchmark, UL's PCMark 10, simulates a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheeting, web browsing, and videoconferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess a laptop's storage load time and throughput.,Three more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally, we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better). ,Our final productivity test is Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.,HP's EliteBook 840 G9 finishes first or second in every event, showing more than ample power for everyday apps (scoring half again the 4,000 points in PCMark 10 that indicate excellent productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace) and even enough muscle for some mild digital content creation, though it's not up to workstation-class CGI rendering or data science. ,For visual testing, we benchmark Windows PCs' graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs). ,We also run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests, rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions, exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.,Lenovo's sleek Slim 9i laptop leads the pack with the HP close behind, but all these notebooks' Intel , fall way short of the 3D performance you'll see from the discrete GPU of a , or workstation. They're fine for casual gaming and streaming media, but not meant for high-speed shoot-'em-ups or particularly heavy-duty visual content creation. ,We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie ,) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off. ,For display testing, we use Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation. That means what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).,No complaints here, as the EliteBook shows more than enough unplugged stamina for a full day's work—plus an evening's Netflix or YouTube entertainment. Bested only by the Dell Latitude in this test lot, this makes the EliteBook ideal for workers who frequently travel. ,Unfortunately, this EliteBook's screen can't match the vivid hues of the Slim 9i's OLED panel in color coverage. However, the screen is more than colorful enough for business apps, and it's actually brighter than its rated 400 nits—again, beat only by the Dell Latitude.,If you can live with a merely fine screen instead of a show-off OLED or 4K display, it's hard to fault HP's EliteBook 840 G9. This business laptop includes everything from 5G mobile broadband to a high-res, AI-enhanced conferencing camera, along with highly competitive performance and additional security. The only question in our minds is how HP can top it with the would-be EliteBook 1000 series, and whether it can earn our Editors' Choice award next time.,With nearly all modern conveniences—including Wi-Fi 6E, 5G, and first-rate security—HP's EliteBook 840 G9 is an excellent corporate traveler...but not quite exemplary.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Canon Maxify GX3020 Review,"An inkjet beast marries a dainty scanner,The Canon Maxify GX3020 offers suitable paper capacity and a low running cost for heavy-duty printing, making it a good home printer or personal printer in a large office, as long as your scanning needs are minimal.,The Canon Maxify GX3020 offers an unusual balance of features. Most , that lack an automatic document feeder (ADF) are entry-level models meant for light-duty printing. But the GX3020's $399.99 list price is definitively not entry level. Neither is its paper capacity nor its low running cost, which are both suitable for heavy-duty printing in multiple settings: home plus home office, small office, or even a personal printer in any size office. You can easily find less-expensive AIOs with ADFs that handle multi-page documents and legal-size pages, such as the ,. But if your primary need is low-cost printing, and you'd like some minimal ability to scan and copy, the GX3020 can be a good fit.,The GX3020 prints, scans, and copies, which rules it out if you need faxing also. Paper handling for printing includes automatic duplexing, along with the highest paper capacity we've seen for any inkjet AIO that's limited to a flatbed for scanning. Almost all flatbed-only models offer a single 100- or 150-sheet tray. The GX3020 offers a 250-sheet drawer, a 100-sheet tray at the rear top of the printer, and a single-sheet straight-through feed in the back for heavyweight paper. The 100-sheet tray lets you keep a second type of paper loaded at all times, as well as easily switch to another type or size of paper when needed, while the 350-sheet capacity is enough to print up to 1,400 sheets per month and still keep paper refills down to about once a week.,As mentioned, paper handling for scanning and copying is limited to manually placing pages on a letter-size flatbed. As a point of comparison, the Canon G7020 offers an ADF that can hold up to 35 letter-size or five legal-size pages for easily scanning multi-page documents.,Physical setup is straightforward. The printer weighs 18.2 pounds, making it easy for one person to unpack and move into place. Its compact size, at 8.6 by 15.8 by 16.4 inches (HWD), also makes it small enough to share a desk with, so you can easily reach the paper tray or see its 1.4-inch front panel control screen, as well as enter copy and scan commands using the surrounding buttons. Once in place, you simply load paper and pour the four bottles of ink—cyan, yellow, magenta, and black—into the tanks. As is typical, the ink bottles are keyed so each will pour only into the right tank. After you finish, the printer goes through a completely automated alignment routine.,Software installation is even easier. After connecting via USB cable or Wi-Fi, you download and run the fully automated setup routine from Canon's website. In my tests, the program ran smoothly, finding the USB-connected printer and installing the driver for it, along with a scan utility. For mobile printing and scanning, you can download a Canon app to your Android or iOS phone or tablet, and you can set the printer to show a QR code on the printer's screen for easy connection. In my tests using an Android phone and a Wi-Fi Direct connection, the printing, scanning, and QR code all worked without problems.,Very much on the plus side, the GX3020 delivers on the promise of any tank-based printer, offering a notably low running cost to justify its high initial price. Canon says the ink that comes with the printer is enough to print 5,000 standard mono pages plus 5,000 standard color pages, while a full set of replacement bottles will print 6,000 mono pages at 0.14 cent per page plus 14,000 color pages at 0.85 cent per page. As with any printer, keep in mind that you shouldn't focus too much on running cost alone. What matters more when you compare printers is the total cost of ownership—running cost plus initial cost—as we discuss in our guide to ,.,The GX3020's print speeds on our tests weren't impressive for the price, especially when compared with less-expensive cartridge-ink-based competition like the ,, but it was comparable to other tank-based printers in its price range.,In my tests using our standard testbed and a USB connection, the GX3020 came in at 16.5ppm (40 seconds)—just a little short of its 18ppm rating—for monochrome text using our 12-page Microsoft Word file and not including the first page. Adding the first page back in dropped the speed to 13.1ppm (55 seconds).,The WF-4830 was notably faster in both cases, while the G7020 was slower, and the ,, our Editors' Choice pick among tank-based AIOs for this category, was essentially tied, though a little slower when not including the first page and a little faster when adding it, due to the GX3020's longer first page out (FPO) time.,For our business applications suite, which includes several files of one to four pages, and also adds graphics and color to most, the WF-4830 was in first place, at 2:08 (12 ppm), thanks to its fast print time beyond the first page swamping any advantage the ST-C4100 had from offering the shortest FPO in the group. However the ST-C4100's fast FPO time earned it a solid second place, at 3:21 (7.5 ppm), saving it a few seconds on each file compared with the GX3020, which was in third place, at 3:40 (6.8ppm). The G7020 earned a convincing last place in the group at 5:38 (4.4ppm).,Text quality was close to top-tier for business inkjets. Characters weren't quite as crisp as you would expect from a laser printer, but all the fonts in our tests that are likely to be used in standard business documents were well-formed, properly spaced, and highly readable at 5 points. All but one looked just as good at 4 points. The loss of crispness compared with laser output was most obvious in two fonts with heavy strokes. Loops and the spaces between characters in both tended to fill in, making the text hard to read at sizes smaller than 10 points for one font and 8 points for the other.,Graphics on plain paper with default settings delivered nicely shaded gradients and saturated color. The printer also did an excellent job with thin lines, including a single-pixel-wide line on a black background. However, although solid fills using bright colors were suitably smooth, I saw banding that varied from subtle to obvious in black fills and dark colors. Photos on the recommended photo paper were at the high end of drugstore quality.,On our water smudging tests, which consist of putting a few drops of water on output printed at least 24 hours earlier and gently wiping it dry, both black and color ink showed only the slightest smudging on plain paper. On the recommended photo paper, I saw only a hint of a smudge for black ink and none for color, and didn't see any water stains after drying. Text on plain paper smudged slightly when using a highlighter, but was still quite readable.,The key differences in capability between the GX3020 and the other AIOs mentioned here is that all three of the others add faxing and an ADF, and all can scan at up to legal size. Between them, the WF-4830 offers the fastest performance, the lowest price, and the highest paper capacity, with two 250-sheet drawers. But as the only cartridge-based printer, it also has the highest running cost, which means the more you print, the more likely it is to be the most expensive of the four in the long run.,Among the three tank-based printers, the G7020 is the least expensive, but is also the slowest and has the lowest paper capacity. The ST-C4100 is the most expensive and offers only one paper tray, but it delivers much the same print performance as the GX3020, while adding an ADF and faxing, which makes it our current top-pick inkjet AIO for this category. ,Compared with all three other printers mentioned here, the GX3020's limited scanning and copying makes it only barely an AIO. But it's less expensive than the ST-C4100, matches it for performance, and offers two paper trays. If what you need is a heavy-duty printer for a home or small office that can also handle occasional minor scanning and copying of up to letter-size originals, the Maxify GX3020 can serve nicely.,The Canon Maxify GX3020 offers suitable paper capacity and a low running cost for heavy-duty printing, making it a good home printer or personal printer in a large office, as long as your scanning needs are minimal.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Thomas Soderstrom,"Years back, when a small website called out for product-review editors. I leapt at the opportunity: I’d just wrapped up a four-year stint as a systems supplier. That experience provided the credentials I’d need for the transition from industry supplier to industry observer. For one thing, I’d been the first source for an exposé on capacitor plague (,) at EDN. ,By that time, I’d already self-published some guidelines on hardcore PC stuff: pin-modifying processors to defeat compatibility checks and overclock non-overclockable systems. I saw a chance to get paid for my knowledge, and have since written more than a thousand pieces (many of them for the seminal tech site Tom's Hardware) before finding my latest opportunity: with PCMag.,System building.

My old reliable Intel-based workhorse desktop stands at the 6th Generation Core level with a 512GB SSD, 32GB of RAM, and gobs of external storage. ,My trusty 3rd Gen Asus Zenbook Pro only comes out for remote conferences (not many of those in the past few years, alas), and even my Samsung Galaxy smartphone is a lower-end model that I bought to replace an old LG unit.

HP Z32k G3 USB-C Display Review,"One primo productivity monitor for creative workers,Since 2004, I have worked on PCMag’s hardware team, covering at various times printers, scanners, projectors, storage, and monitors. I currently focus my testing efforts on 3D printers, pro and productivity displays, and drives and SSDs of all sorts. ,HP's latest Z32k G3 monitor can easily handle color-sensitive creative tasks, and it adds cutting-edge features like IPS Black and Thunderbolt 4, with a price to match.,The HP Z32k G3 USB-C Display ($839), a , with some creative chops, can handle tasks like working with video and web-based art with aplomb thanks to its strong color coverage and accuracy. It also has much better contrast than most IPS monitors do. Its rich selection of ports includes Thunderbolt 4, and puts even standalone docking stations to shame. All this goodness doesn't come cheap, but the Z32k's features and performance earn it our Editors' Choice nod as an elite productivity monitor.,The Z32k G3 is the first HP monitor to employ ,, an in-plane switching (IPS) technology variant that effectively doubles the contrast ratio over standard IPS by rendering much deeper blacks. Only a handful of IPS Black monitors have made it to market so far; we previously saw this technology's effectiveness in the,, which earned an Editors' Choice award for elite productivity displays.,The heart of the Z32k G3 is its 32-inch (measured diagonally) screen. It features a native resolution of 3,840 by 2,160 pixels, better known as UHD or 4K, which makes for a high pixel density of 140 pixels per inch (ppi). All else being equal, the higher the pixel density—how closely pixels are packed together—the sharper the image, and the Z32k G3 should be fine for working with small text, complex diagrams, graphics, and photos. It doesn't have the pixel density of its smaller sibling, the , (163 ppi) or any other 27-inch 4K panel—the smaller the screen for a given resolution, the higher the pixel density will be—but it's more than adequate for most any task a creative professional might need it for.,As is typical of IPS panels, the Z32k G3 offers wide viewing angles, with a rating of up to 178 degrees for both vertical and horizontal viewing, meaning that colors should remain reasonably true—free of shifting or posterization—even when seen at extreme angles, from the side or above. This proved to be the case in my testing.,Including the stand, the Z32k G3 measures 23.8 by 28.1 by 8.5 inches (HWD), and it weighs 19.8 pounds. Surrounding the screen are narrow black bezels, plus an additional thin border, on all four sides. The stand supports the full range of ergonomic features. You can adjust the monitor’s height by up to 5.9 inches, and tilt the top of the panel up to 5 degrees toward you or up to 20 degrees away from you. You can swivel the panel up to 45 degrees in either direction, and pivot it from landscape to portrait and back, something not every large productivity monitor is able to do—for instance, the , lacks pivot capability.,Should you prefer to arm- or wall-mount the Z32k G3, there is a square pattern of holes placed 100mm apart to which you can attach a VESA bracket.,As is the case with the Z27k G3, the Z32k is endowed with a profusion of ports. Most notably, the Z32k upgrades the smaller monitor's USB-C port to Thunderbolt 4. Thunderbolt 4 uses a USB-C-shaped connector, and is backward-compatible with previous Thunderbolt versions as well as all USB standards. This connection provides up to 100 watts of power delivery to a laptop, as well as transfers data from the computer (assuming it supports Thunderbolt 4) at up to 40GBps via DisplayPort over USB Alternate Mode. ,The Z32k includes one DisplayPort input and one DisplayPort output; the latter lets you daisy-chain another 4K monitor to your setup. With a hub of four USB 3.2 Type-A ports, you can add a mouse, hard drives, and other peripherals to the mix. There's also one USB-C and one USB-B port, a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports, and an audio-out jack.,Most of the ports face downward in back, which traditionally is an awkward place for connecting cables, but with the Z32k you can simply pivot the monitor into portrait mode to easily access the connectors. One USB-A and one USB-C port are located on the side for even easier access.,The Z32k also has an RJ-45 jack that supports gigabit Ethernet, letting you connect to a LAN even if your laptop lacks an Ethernet port or if Wi-Fi is spotty or nonexistent. Supported network manageability features include PXE Boot, LAN/WLAN switching, Wake-on-LAN (WoL), and MAC address pass-through (MAPT). The first (for Preboot eXecution Environment) allows a computer to boot directly from the network. LAN/WLAN switching disables the laptop's Wi-Fi when the monitor is connected to a LAN. WoL, meanwhile, enables a computer to be awakened remotely from a low-power state. The MAPT function lets a connected laptop bypass the monitor/dock's MAC address so it can be uniquely identified on the network with its own MAC address. These functions require that the PC to which the Z32k is connected be in a wake or sleep state rather than off.,In back, in the lower left corner, is a four-way rocker switch with central button, which lets you access and control the Z32k's onscreen display (OSD). It is akin to the mini-joystick controllers found on many gaming and professional monitors, and is easy to learn to use. This sort of switch is preferable to the multiple control buttons still found on many monitors, especially budget models.,HP backs the Z32k with a three-year standard warranty, which is typical of higher-end productivity monitors; the , and the MSI MS321UP also have three-year warranties. Philips does it one better, warrantying its 329P1H for a full four years.,I tested the Z32k G3's brightness, contrast ratio, and color accuracy using a , and Portrait Displays' Calman software. The charts in this section were generated in Calman.,HP rates the Z32k G3 at 400 nits (candelas per square meter) of luminance, and it easily cleared that in our testing, clocking in at 432 nits. As an IPS Black monitor, its contrast ratio is rated at 2,000:1, and it tested reasonably close, at 1,890:1. (Standard IPS monitors are rated at 1,000:1, and seldom test above 1,200:1.),According to HP, the Z32k G3 covers up to 100% of sRGB, the color gamut for web-based art and numerous other applications. In my testing, it did cover a full 100% of that color space—see the chromaticity (color-coverage) chart below. ,The panel is also rated as covering 98% of DCI-P3, a color space used for digital video; our test unit did better, covering 99.9% (see the chart below). ,HP doesn't offer a figure for the Adobe RGB space; it covered 87.1% of it in our testing. Although the Z32k G3's sRGB and DCI-P3 superb color coverage is great for working with web-based art and video, those using the Adobe RGB space for processing photos and art for printing will likely want to look for a , such as the , that provides more complete Adobe RGB coverage. (See more about ,.),Delta E (dE for short) is a measure of color accuracy, namely the difference between the hue of a displayed color and the color input that the monitor received. The dE figure that appears in monitor specs is the average of a large number of individual color readings from across the spectrum; the lower the value, the more accurate the color. Many professional monitors tout a dE of less than 2 in various color spaces. HP doesn't list a claimed Delta E among the monitor's specs, but the Z32k G3 scored under 2 in our testing for both sRGB (1.8) and DCI-P3 (1.94). (See the chart for the sRGB results below.),I also did some real-world testing by viewing a selection of film clips as well as a suite of test photos, and the results were excellent on both counts: vivid colors and strong contrast, with good retention of details in both bright and dark areas.,When we reviewed the Z27k G3 nearly two years ago, we were impressed with its color coverage, profusion of ports, and ergonomic excellence. The Z32k has a larger screen, upgrades the earlier model's USB-C port to Thunderbolt 4, and its IPS Black panel provides considerably higher contrast than the Z27k G3 offers. As you'd expect, the Z32k sells at a considerably higher price than its 27-inch cousin, which is already on the pricey side.,One thing the Z32k lacks is the videoconferencing features found in many recent business monitors such as the ,—webcam, powerful speakers, dual microphones, and the like. These can all enhance the online meeting experience, but most laptops do at least an adequate job for teleconferencing. If yours doesn't, you might want to choose a different monitor, if replacing your laptop isn't in the cards.,A standout feature of the Z32k is its rich selection of ports, even among so-called docking-station monitors. The addition of Thunderbolt 4 adds both speed and power delivery to your system, particularly if your laptop supports that standard. Although the Editors' Choice Philips 329P1H has a lot to offer—including great sRGB and DCI-P3 coverage—at a comparatively low price, it has a more modest selection of ports than the Z32k does.,By virtue of its excellent IPS Black-enhanced contrast, mastery of the sRGB and DCI-P3 color spaces, ergonomic design, and huge selection of ports, the HP Z32k G3 USB-C Display becomes our latest Editors' Choice pick for high-end productivity monitors. It's ideal for workers who spend much of their time processing video and photos for the web.,HP's latest Z32k G3 monitor can easily handle color-sensitive creative tasks, and it adds cutting-edge features like IPS Black and Thunderbolt 4, with a price to match.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Hyte Y40 Review,"Vertical-video-card builds made easy,Years back, when a small website called out for product-review editors. I leapt at the opportunity: I’d just wrapped up a four-year stint as a systems supplier. That experience provided the credentials I’d need for the transition from industry supplier to industry observer. For one thing, I’d been the first source for an exposé on capacitor plague (,) at EDN. ,Want to install a vertical-mount graphics card, but not give up the rest of your expansion slots? Hyte's Y40 lets you do that, and simplifies building a showy system for a moderate price.,Trendy among show systems, PC builds with vertically mounted graphics cards are getting way more common, as case makers accommodate DIY-ers who want to give that look a shot. Designs that stand the card parallel to the motherboard have but a single major issue that has prevented adoption by more buyers: The , may allow for it, but those expensive PCI Express 4.0 riser cables required to make it possible are usually sold separately. Of the several cases we’ve reviewed of late that support vertical mounting as an aesthetic option, some have required buyers to splurge on additional brackets to mount the card, and none has included the cable in the box. New brand Hyte changes that, with its glassy, glossy Y40 ATX mid-tower ($149.99), which marries lots of glass and a bundled riser cable to offer a slick basis for a PC build with a vertical card mount.,Available in red, white, or black finishes and enclosed on two sides with tinted tempered glass, the Y40 features fan mounts on the top, bottom, right and rear panels, along with separate dust filters for the bottom intake fan and the power supply’s air inlet.,Hyte places its front panel ports at the bottom edge, making it obvious that the company would prefer you to place its case atop, rather than beneath, your desk. The single audio jack combines stereo headphone output and monaural microphone input, the two Type-A USB ports connect to a USB 3.x Gen 1 cable, and the single Type-C port uses a USB 3.x Gen 2 cable. Power-on indicator lighting surrounds the power button.,A unique double set of expansion slots around back includes seven half-height slots in the normal position, plus four “remote” slots at full height. The design allows builders to fill all but one of the seven half-height slots with expansion cards while retaining a full-height graphics card up to 422mm in length.,The part that makes it so easy to keep six of the original seven slot locations open (even if only for half-height cards) appears to be nothing more than a piece of plastic and metal bracket that guides the included PCIe 4.0 extension cable over the top of nearby cards. It can be placed in any of the half-height slots, though the further down it goes, the more tightly its cable will be bent. Designed to hold a graphics card with an extra-thick cooler, the four full-height slot covers serve only a single PCIe x16 physical connector via that cable. But if you have one of the latest mega-beast GeForce RTX 4090 cards, you’ve got the girth.,As for motherboard support, this is really an ATX case. Though I noted no obstructions that would preclude the use of larger boards, PCBs greater than the standard 9.6-inch depth of ATX will obscure the Y40’s cable passages, and those longer than 10.8 inches will interfere with the placement of 140mm fans on the dual-fan side mount. So we'd plan around ATX here.,While radiators up to 280mm format can be placed inside the side mount, users who want something bigger will find a 360mm-format mount on the top panel that can hold radiators that are actually up to 410mm long (including end caps). Offset to the left from motherboard standoffs, a big radiator cleared the surface of our motherboard by around 52mm and even left 6.6mm of clearance between our radiator fans and the tops of our 44mm-tall memory heat spreaders. Those who choose this space for their radiator will need much of that offset regardless of the height of their memory modules since, at 20mm, the space between the motherboard and top panel is thinner than most of the devices that users would mount here.,The dual 140mm/120mm fan mount is offset approximately 18mm from the surface of the motherboard tray. Combining that distance with the length of standoffs would allow 25mm-thick fans to (barely) clear the edge of an oversize motherboard…were cabling not a concern. A drive tray that fits to the back of the motherboard tray is drilled to accept a single 3.5-inch or two 2.5-inch drives.,Hyte’s stated 224mm power-supply depth limit extends from the power supply’s mount to the intake fan. Removing the fan would give users an extra 140mm of space, since the included 120mm model lines up with the rear edge of the optional 140mm mounts.,The Y40 includes a folded instruction sheet, a handy Phillips-to-hex socket for repositioning standoffs, individual resealable bags of screws, a breakout adapter for connecting individual headphone/microphone leads to its headset combo jack, and five ratcheting cable ties that may or may not be Zip branded.,Cables off the chassis itself include two three-pin fan (one shown below), HD Audio (for the front panel's headset jack), an FPANEL combination block (for the power button and LED), USB 3.2 Gen 1 (for the two Type-A front-panel ports) and USB 3.2 Gen 2 (for the Type-C front-panel port). Though the combined FPANEL connector still confuses some builders, it’s a 24-year-old Intel spec that was adopted by most motherboard brands over a dozen years ago: It simply took another decade for case manufacturers to get aboard.,Today’s sample build inside the Hyte case uses the ATX motherboard option of our standardized test configuration:,The graphics card does a great job of hiding cable entry points along the motherboard’s bottom edge from this angle, while top-edge cables are hidden at most view angles by the top-mounted radiator. We placed Corsair’s radiator there to assist in cooling the motherboard’s CPU voltage regulator, and recommend that anyone using the side mount for their closed-loop liquid cooler consider placing at least one additional 120mm fan on the top panel above their CPU socket.,Then again, a full set of fans would make the case look more complete in a show build, and the decision to put a 360mm radiator on top or a 280mm unit on the side would be the builder’s concern. To create a fair performance comparison, we just tested this sample with the same component set as previously used to test similarly sized cases.,Lian Li's , was the closest review sample we could find to matching the Y40’s glass face and side, but it unfortunately has an enlarged side chamber similar to the H9 Elite from NZXT…so we included both. By the time we were configuring charts, the Y40’s noise data led us to add the , to the mix and alas, all four samples ended up within 3 degrees F of each other regarding CPU temperature. Not much that's telling there. ,The Y40 ties for worst with the O11 Dynamic EVO in voltage regulator temperature, owing primarily to the dimensional relationship between the thing that provides the airflow (our radiator’s fans) and the thing that needs it (the heat sinks surrounding our CPU socket). In the case of the Y40, the extreme leftward offset and low positioning likely leaves the motherboard’s upper heatsink outside of the fans’ flow path.,As for GPU temperature, the Y40 finishes in an approximate three-way tie with the Pop XL Silent and the H9 Elite, all three are edged out by the O11 Dynamic EVO.,Sound-pressure-level results show how the Y40’s glass front panel roughly matches the Pop XL Silent’s damped plastic front panel in the amount of noise it allows to escape. The glass reflects more noise back into the case, so anyone standing , the case might think it louder. (We don’t do that.),Like the O11 Dynamic EVO that came before it, the Hyte Y40 performs adequately without even filling its side vent with fans. Likewise, building out either of these cases as intended will increase its cooling performance and noise. Conversely, the Hyte Y40 does something the we’ve not seen , of its competitors do: It supports a vertical graphics card bracket and cable without excluding the use of any other expansion slots.,Then again, while its competitors force builders to choose between one vertical , multiple horizontal full-height cards, the Y40 opens up your options by simultaneously supporting one full-height card vertically and multiple half-height cards horizontally. Like the top radiator mount that’s offset far enough to fit radiators past 50mm-tall DIMMs but low enough that the offset was actually needed, and like the side panel that supports 280mm-format radiators but not longer ones, it’s all a balancing act for a case that costs $150 but includes a special cable worth $40 to $60. In short: It performs on par with its spiritual kin, and it's a great case choice if you like the look and know you’ll use the cable.,Want to install a vertical-mount graphics card, but not give up the rest of your expansion slots?

Microsoft Lists Review,"An Airtable clone that's missing features ,Microsoft Lists is a simple database tool for collaboration, but it's missing significant features.,All planning, and consequently many ,, boil down to lists. It doesn't matter if you're tracking inventory, thinking up which books you'd like to read, or training a new employee—you're going to be making lists. You can use paper, or even a spreadsheet, but neither of those tools are designed to make it easy to look at the same list in different contexts. For that, you need a database.,Microsoft Lists was built from the ground up to be the simplest database management tool you can think of. If the idea sounds familiar, that's because it's essentially the pitch for ,, an Editors’ Choice winner that does the same thing. The similarities don't end there, either—you could very well mistake a screenshot of one application for the other. You might also compare Lists to ,, a collaborative productivity tool built around workspaces, though Asana is designed more specifically for managing workflows and projects. But while Airtable and Asana are mature products, Microsoft Lists feels like a work in progress. ,Microsoft Lists is, as of this writing, , with a Microsoft account. That preview is limited to the first 200,000 people who sign up on a first-come, first-served basis. This free plan is limited to 50 lists with up to 200MB of attachments and 1,500 items per list. ,Airtable offers a free version with unlimited databases, which are functionally similar to lists in Microsoft Lists. Databases are limited to 2GB of storage and 1,200 records per database, meaning that Airtable's free version is more generous overall than the limited free version offered by Microsoft Lists. Asana offers unlimited tasks and projects to free users with unlimited file storage. Individual file attachments are capped at 100MB, however. ,Microsoft Lists is also included with all paid Microsoft 365 business, commercial, education, and government plans that include SharePoint. These plans allow each user to create 2,000 lists per SharePoint site collection. Each list can contain up to 30,000,000 items/rows and 1TB of attachments/storage per user, along with enterprise-level security and compliance features, according to a Microsoft representative. The most affordable Microsoft 365 plan that includes lists, Business Basic, costs $6 per user per month and includes access to apps including Microsoft Word, Excel, and Teams along with 1TB of OneDrive Storage.,Airtable's paid plans start at $12 per person per month when billed monthly or $120 per person per year billed annually. Other similar applications include ,, which starts at $19 per person per month, and ,, which costs roughly $10 to $20 per person per month. Asana’s paid plans start at $13.49 per person per month when billed monthly or $131.88 per person per year when billed annually. In addition to offering database functionality, Smartsheet also fits our definition of a traditional ,, making it quite capable for other uses.,, which includes Microsoft Lists along with the rest of Microsoft's Office apps, is cheaper than most of the applications that compete with Microsoft Lists, which means the pricing is a huge advantage for Lists.,Unlike most Microsoft 365 applications, there's no desktop version of Microsoft Lists. It's only available in a browser or as a mobile app for Android, iPhone, and iPad. According to Microsoft, the most compatible browsers for the app are Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. In testing, Lists was buggy in Safari—the occasional button did nothing when I clicked it, for example. But it worked well in Chrome.,I tested the iPad version and it had every feature I could find on the web version, along with the ability to swipe between objects in that view. It's easy to imagine using the mobile app to quickly update projects while on the road. Just note that you need internet access to use the application because it has no offline functionality. ,Anyone with an eligible Microsoft account can head to , to sign in. As of this writing, users without a supported account, such as those with a Personal or Home account, are only eligible for the preview, which is limited to 200,000 total users and is the version I tested for this review. ,Once you have access to Lists, you can create a ,which is what Microsoft Lists calls each of its simplified databases. A variety of templates are included, such as lists for organizing an event, scheduling articles for a blog or publication, and thinking up gift ideas. ,You can choose a template or create a new list from scratch. The default view shows All Items in your new list, and it looks similar to a spreadsheet, though it's different. ,The top row holds the name of each column, as is typical in a spreadsheet. Each row below that top row represents a single ,, meaning a specific object in the database. As an example, I tested Lists by building a simple editorial calendar. Every row represents an article, and I can add attributes to other columns, such as a description of the article, author name, current status, deadline, and so on. ,When you add a column you need to decide what kind of information will live there. The options are text, multiple choice, the date and time, multiple lines of text, a person, a number, yes/no, a hyperlink, and an image. ,If you've ever used Airtable, Microsoft Lists will look very familiar. The user interface is strikingly similar and so is the functionality. The similarity is even more obvious if you double-click any item to see a summary, which includes the information from every column along with an area for comments between collaborators.,Creating and populating Lists seems simple enough, but what you're actually doing is building a database. Microsoft is careful to avoid using words like ""database"" and ""table"" in product marketing—even the name is Lists. Make no mistake, though, Lists is hiding an object-oriented database here, and that means you can look at the same information in all sorts of different ways. ,In the top-right corner of any list is a plus sign. Press it to make a new View of your data. You get three main views: List, which is the default; Calendar, which shows all objects on a monthly calendar; and Gallery, which shows each item in a separate box.,These different views allow you to look at the same items in different contexts, and you can make as many views as you like. You can also use the information in any column to filter and sort information. For example, if a project has a start and end date you could have a calendar view that displays when you'll be working on which projects. Alternatively, you could make a calendar view that only shows due dates. You can also do basic conditional formatting, for example, to add color coding to different statuses in a status column, like green for ""in progress"" and red for ""overdue."",The approach is similar to Airtable's with one crucial exception: there's no , view (also sometimes called a board view in other apps). The Kanban view in Airtable lets you use it in a manner similar to ,, dragging an item from one column to another as it progresses through a workflow. Airtable also offers a Forms view, which makes it easy to collect information from people outside your organization and automatically add it to your database. Microsoft Lists doesn't. Lists could use more of these features, especially because it has serious limitations importing information.,Microsoft Lists can only import data from and export data to CSV files. Oddly enough, Microsoft doesn't support its own Excel file format here. Excel users have to export to CSV before importing. That's doable, but it adds an annoying extra step.,To be fair, Asana also only supports importing from CSV files, but I expect better from the company that actually makes Excel. ,, an experimental product similar to Microsoft Lists which Google will launch sometime in 2023, supports importing from Google Sheets. Airtable supports importing from Google Sheets , Microsoft Excel, not to mention Microsoft Access.,Microsoft Lists exists, in part, to offer an alternative to people who are using Excel spreadsheets as an improvised database. It's odd, in that context, that Excel files aren't supported. People are already storing compatible information in a Microsoft-owned file format. Why isn't there a quick way to get it? ,One more import quibble: It's only possible to import data to a ,list. You can't import data to a list that already exists, meaning data entry has to be manual. At the risk of repeating myself, Airtable offers this ability. ,Multiple times, while testing Lists, I'd attempt to do something only to be told the feature isn't ready yet. For example, I tried to click a tab after setting up a List using a default template, only to find out that grouped views aren't yet available. Messages like these don’t inspire a lot of confidence. I'd rather the feature just not be there. ,The free version of Lists does not have any automation features. I read about , in the documentation, but they sound simple compared with what alternatives like Airtable can do, much less Smartsheet which is known for its automation capabilities. Airtable also works with , and ,, allowing you to integrate with other apps regardless of whether Airtable offers native integration with them. Microsoft Lists doesn't offer such integrations. ,There's an entire class of applications that are worth using primarily because you already pay for them. A lot of people prefer Slack to Microsoft Teams, for example, but an organization's accounting department may decide that it doesn't make sense to pay for Slack when they already have access to Teams included in their Microsoft 365 for Business subscription.,Microsoft Lists falls into this same category. Airtable, an Editors’ Choice winner among collaboration apps, is superior to Lists in most every way, including integration with Microsoft's own software. But employees in organizations that already pay for Microsoft 365 have access to Lists right now, without the need for another software subscription. And that's who I'd recommend Lists to: people who already pay for Microsoft 365 and need an easy-to-use database tool. Lists can work well for planning, inventory, and even some lightweight team collaboration. ,If you’re not already paying for Microsoft 365, though, you should first look into Airtable, which offers more features and has a generous free version.,Microsoft Lists is a simple database tool for collaboration, but it's missing significant features.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Synology WRX560 Review,"This first-class router is a stand-up performer,I’ve been working with computers for ages, starting with a multi-year stint in purchasing for a major IBM reseller in New York City before eventually landing at PCMag (back when it was still in print as ,). I spent more than 14 years on staff, most recently as the director of operations for PC Labs, before hitting the freelance circuit as a contributing editor. ,The Synology WRX560 is an affordable dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router that offers speedy throughput, strong signal transmissions, and multi-gig networking.,`When we reviewed Synology's flagship , router last year, we gave it high marks for its multi-gig connectivity and strong parental controls, but were disappointed by its 5GHz throughput performance. The new, more affordable Synology WRX560 ($219.99) also offers multi-gig networking and the same robust parental controls, but this dual-band , delivered superior throughput on both radio bands and good signal strength in our tests. Its file transfer performance could use a boost, but the WRX560 is an otherwise excellent, feature-rich mainstream router that earns an Editors' Choice award.,The WRX560 doesn't look like a typical desktop router. Its 9.1-by-7.6-by-2.5-inch (HWD) black enclosure stands vertically, with beveled edges and grillwork that give it a futuristic, minimalist look. The device's vertical stance does make it vulnerable to tipping over, which is exactly what happened when my cat decided to rub against it, and there are no options for mounting the router on a wall.,You won't find the usual external antennas here; instead, the Synology uses six internal antennas to communicate over the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio bands. Three small LED indicators on the front signal system status, Wi-Fi activity, and WAN activity. ,Most of the WRX560's ports are located on the rear panel, including a 2.5Gbps WAN/LAN port, a 1Gbps WAN port, and three 1Gbps LAN ports. They are joined by a power port, a power button, and a reset button. On the left side, you'll see a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port and WPS and Wi-Fi on/off buttons.,The WRX560 is a dual-band AX3000 router, which means it can reach theoretical max speeds of 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 2,400Mbps on the 5GHz band. It uses a 1.4GHz quad-core CPU and 512MB of DDR4 RAM, and it supports Wi-Fi 6 technologies including 160MHz channel transmissions, WPA3 encryption, MU-MIMO data streaming, direct-to-client beamforming, and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). It's mesh-ready and can be teamed with other compatible Synology routers to create a seamless mesh Wi-Fi network. Like the RT6600ax, the Synology WRX560 uses the UNII-4 (5.9GHz) spectrum to access additional 20MHz and 160MHz channels, but it is not a Wi-Fi 6E router and has no access to the 6GHz radio band.,You install and manage the WRX560 using the DS Router mobile app or the web-based Synology Router Manager (SRM) operating system. Similar to the DiskStation Manager OS used by Synology NAS devices, SRM offers a Windows-like interface that makes configuring the router easy. The desktop contains icons labeled Control Panel, Network Center, Wi-Fi Connect, Safe Access, Package Center, and SRM Help. You use Network Center to manage network connections, monitor CPU and memory usage, and configure QoS, port forwarding, and port triggering settings. The Wi-Fi Connect icon takes you to a screen where you can configure Wi-Fi settings and guest networking, as well as view a list of connected clients and which band they're using.,The Safe Access icon opens a screen where you can create parental control profiles and assign devices and web filters to each profile. Preset filters include Child, Employee, and Guest, or you can create custom profiles. Other Safe Access options allow you to enable network protection settings to safeguard network devices against malicious content and access to dangerous websites, as well as setting access-time quotas and monitoring client activity.,Use the Control Panel to configure external storage devices, enable file services, view router status information, and back up your router settings. Finally, Package Center is where you go to update the Safe Access software, install Synology's VPN Server Plus software, and download media server and Radius server applications.,The WRX60 proved easy to install. I used the Synology Router Manager (SRM) web console and started by connecting the router to my modem and desktop PC; then, I powered up the modem and router at the same time. I opened a browser and typed , in the address bar, which opened a start screen. I tapped Start, created an account, and gave the new network a name and password. ,After a minute, I logged back into the SRM operating system and followed the Quick Setup wizard instructions to make sure I was using DHCP. I enabled Quick Connect which allows you to access the router from anywhere, and then updated the firmware. The installation was complete. ,The WRX560 turned in some of the highest throughput scores we've seen from a mainstream Wi-Fi 6 router. With a score of 134Mbps in our 2.4GHz close proximity (same room) test, it outperformed the , (128Mbps), the , (126Mbps), and the , (121Mbps). It also led the pack in the 30-foot test, delivering 62Mbps versus 52Mbps for the TP-Link, 42Mbps for the Linksys, and 44Mbps for the Asus.,Results in our 5GHz throughput tests were similar. The Synology's 931Mbps in the close proximity test was significantly faster than the 846Mbps of the ROG Strix, the 830Mbps of the Hydra Pro 6, and the 811Mbps of the Archer AX75. Its 576Mbps in the 30-foot test also took top honors, beating the Asus' 424Mbps, the Linksys' 400Mbps, and the TP-Link's 273Mbps.,To determine a router's read and write file transfer performance, we time how long it takes to move a 1.5GB folder containing photos, video, music, and office document files back and forth between a USB 3.0 drive and a desktop PC, both connected to the router...,Here, the WRX560's performance was merely average: Its write speed of 47MBps was a bit quicker than the TP-Link's 42MBps, but slower than the Asus (69MBps) and Linksys (55MBps). Similarly, the Synology's read score of 48MBps edged the Archer's 44MBps but not the Linksys' 57MBps or the ROG Strix's 85MBps.,We test wireless signal strength using an , Sidekick Wi-Fi diagnostic device and the company's Survey mobile app to generate heat maps that show 2.4GHz and 5GHz signal strength throughout our test home. (Note: Ekahau is owned by PCMag's parent company Ziff Davis.) ,The colors on the maps represent signal strength—dark green for the strongest signal, yellow for a weaker one, and gray indicating no detectable coverage. The circle on the map represents the location of the router. As you can see, the WRX560 did a fine job of delivering strong Wi-Fi throughout the house, although signal strength for both bands became a little weaker in the garage.,Superior throughput performance, wide signal coverage, and the SRM operating system make the Synology WRX560 an excellent choice among dual-band routers. It comes with strong parental control and network security software and is equipped with a multi-gig WAN/LAN port, and you can use it as part of a whole-home mesh configuration. ,Even with merely ordinary file transfer performance and a potentially wobbly stance, it earns an Editors' Choice award as a mainstream Wi-Fi 6 router.,The Synology WRX560 is an affordable dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router that offers speedy throughput, strong signal transmissions, and multi-gig networking.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2 Review,"Upscale earbuds with expert tuning, but less effective ANC,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,The premium Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2 earphones stand out for their dual-driver setup and hi-res streaming capabilities, but offer just average noise cancellation for the price.,At $399, Bowers & Wilkins' flagship Pi7 S2 , cost $100 more than the already expensive ,, placing them among the priciest models we've tested. For the extra money, you get top-notch tuning and an additional balanced armature in each earpiece that enables superior sound quality. An excellent default audio signature, a solid array of codec support, and a charging case with the ability to transmit audio are all marks in the Pi7 S2's favor, but the lack of an EQ in the companion app and uncompetitive active noise cancellation (ANC) are disappointing at this high price. We ultimately prefer the , ($249) and the , ($299) because they're substantially more effective at blocking noise and offer more customization options. ,Available in black, blue, or white, the attractive Pi7 S2 earpieces have circular outer panels with a metallic finish. They fit securely and feel comfortable even over long listening sessions. You get three pairs of silicone eartips (small, medium, and large) in the package. ,Internally, each earpiece houses a 9.2mm dynamic driver and a balanced armature that covers the higher frequencies—each driver also gets a separate amplifier. Unfortunately, Bowers & Wilkins doesn’t share frequency range specs.,The earphones support the slightly outdated Bluetooth 5.0 standard. That's a notable limitation because we sometimes encountered problems when trying to connect the earbuds to the companion app. That aside, they work with the AAC, AptX, AptX Adaptive, AptX HD, and SBC Bluetooth ,. If you have a compatible Android phone, AptX Adaptive and AptX HD support means you can stream at up to 24-bit/48KHz quality. But the more affordable , earbuds ($279.99) have the advantage of LDAC support, which allows for an even higher streaming bitrate.,The outer panels of each earbud feature capacitive touch controls. Tap once on either side to handle playback and calls. Tap twice to skip to the next track or three times to go to the previous one. A press-and-hold gesture on the left and right earpieces respectively toggles the ANC mode or summons your device's voice assistant. The controls are responsive and intuitive, but it's still easy to accidentally trigger a function when you simply mean to adjust the fit. ,An , is modest, but typical for noise-cancelling earbuds. The first digit (5) means they are nearly dustproof, while the second digit (4) means they can withstand only light water splashes from any direction. They should be fine for sweaty workouts or in light rain, but don't try submerging them or exposing them to the pressure of a faucet.,The bulky charging case isn't at all waterproof, so make sure to dry the earpieces before you place them inside. It sports a metallic lid that flips open to reveal the charging docks and a manual pairing button. The front has a status LED and an additional button that enables an innovative audio transmission feature. In essence, you can connect the case (with the included USB-C-to-3.5mm cable) to an external source (such as a touch-screen console on a plane) to stream audio to your earbuds. In practice, we had to turn off Bluetooth on the original device we paired the earphones with to get this feature to work. ,Bowers & Wilkins estimates the earbuds can last roughly five hours per charge with ANC off and that the case holds an additional 16 hours of charge. Of course, your results will vary based on your volume levels and use of ANC. These numbers aren't very impressive, but we're not surprised that it takes so much power to drive a total of four drivers, each with a dedicated amp. The company claims that you get roughly two hours of playback from 15 minutes of charging, which should at least take the edge off of your battery life concerns.,The Bowers & Wilkins Music app (available for Android and iOS) is the weakest part of the experience. For starters, we often had trouble trying to connect the earbuds to the app, despite a reliable connection to our test phone. We had to repeat the process several times to get them to appear.,Once you get past that hurdle, the main screen shows an image of the product, along with battery life readouts for both earpieces and the case. Below this, there’s a Noise Cancellation section—you can switch between ANC On, Auto (the ANC adapts automatically to the ambient noise levels in your environment), and Off settings. Further down, you can toggle the ambient (Passthrough) mode and adjust its intensity with a fader.,Additionally, you can manage device connections, adjust the Wear Sensor settings, and change the audio quality (standard, medium, high, or highest) for both cellular and Wi-Fi streaming scenarios. For people who don't need to worry about data limits or are on Wi-Fi most of the time, we recommend sticking with the top-level quality. If you subscribe to , such as Qobuz, Tidal, or Deezer, you can further set up integrations that enable in-app streaming controls. ,Otherwise, the app lets you install firmware updates and contact support. You don't get an , anywhere, which is severely disappointing in light of the high price. Many companion apps for far more affordable models have that feature.,The six-mic array here produced merely decent results in our noise cancellation tests. The earbuds dial back powerful low-frequency rumble (like from an airplane) to a degree, but those sounds remain mostly audible. The earphones were slightly effective at cutting back lower frequencies from a recording of a busy restaurant with clanging dishes and boisterous conversation, but most of the highs passed through cleanly. ,We didn’t notice much of a difference between the regular and adaptive ANC modes in testing. But more concerning is the amount of hiss these modes add to the signal—they effectively amplify the noise floor of a quiet room and make it sound louder than if they were inactive. This is a common flaw of less expensive noise-cancelling earbuds, but not something we expect at this price. ,Bowers & Wilkins simply doesn't compete with Apple and Bose here. The aforementioned models from those companies nearly completely cancel out loud low-frequency rumble and other ambient noises. ,On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” the earbuds deliver a powerful low-frequency response that's robust at moderate volumes and free of distortion at maximum levels. They also have no issues reproducing the sub-bass at the 34-second mark of Kendrick Lamar’s “Loyalty.” The synth line gets progressively deeper, but the dynamic drivers don't struggle to output any of this low-end rumble. The balanced armatures further ensure a solid clarity in the vocals here.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, better reveals the sound signature. The drums and Callahan’s baritone vocals benefit from a full, robust delivery with low-mid richness and high-mid clarity. The balanced armatures enable additional definition in everything from the vocals to the acoustic strums to the higher-register percussive hits. The sound signature has some sculpting, but the balanced presentation works wonderfully for most genres. For instance, we quite enjoyed the higher-frequency detail on excellent recordings like Broadcast’s “Pendulum” and Miles Davis’ “Pharaoh's Dance.” ,Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, have a slightly bass-forward delivery. However, the crisp treatment of the upper frequencies means that the higher-register brass, strings, and vocals still sound clear and full of detail. ,We're very happy with the Bowers & Wilkins signature, even if it isn't clinically accurate. Most listeners are likely to prefer this type of sound to a flatter response. The lack of an EQ remains a shortcoming, however, because it prevents you from adjusting the signature to taste.,The mic array offers strong intelligibility. We didn't have any problem understanding every word from a test recording on an iPhone and the signal sounded relatively strong. You shouldn't experience any call clarity issues over a reliable signal.,The Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2 earphones excel in the audio department—their dual-driver approach results in fantastic sound and support for hi-res streaming should appeal to ,. We're not thrilled about the absence of an in-app EQ, but the default sound signature is simply top-notch. The substandard active noise cancellation is less forgivable, however, especially for $399. The aforementioned Apple AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II remain more well-rounded options, particularly because they offer far greater customization options and noise cancellation. And if you want to spend less, you might want to consider the dual-driver , earphones ($149.99), which also support the LDAC codec. ,The premium Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2 earphones stand out for their dual-driver setup and hi-res streaming capabilities, but offer just average noise cancellation for the price.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Canon IVY 2 Mini Photo Printer Review,"A first-class pocket photo printer with collage and circular-sticker options,I focus on printer and scanner technology and reviews. I have been writing about computer technology since well before the advent of the internet. I have authored or co-authored 20 books—including titles in the popular ,and, series—on digital design and desktop publishing software applications. My published expertise in those areas includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, and QuarkXPress, as well as prepress imaging technology. (Over my long career, though, I have covered many aspects of IT.),Canon's improved IVY 2 Mini prints good-looking photos and stickers at competitive running costs, making it an excellent smartphone companion for little on-the-go pics.,Zero ink (Zink) portable , don't quite match the image quality of dye-sublimation models, but the output of the original , reviewed here in June 2018 was mediocre even compared to its Zink competitors. Canon's new IVY 2 Mini Photo Printer produces better small-format (2-by-3-inch) prints at similarly low running costs, making it a good value, especially with a current discount from $129.99 to $99.99. Our only real complaint about this IVY is that, even ,the discount, it lists for $30 more than the , that just copped an Editors' Choice award among Zink smartphone companions.,Instead of ink, Zink photo printers use special paper infused with colors released by the printer's application of heat, producing images in a single pass. Canon says that with proper storage, images from the IVY 2 should last for up to a century. By contrast, dye-sublimation or dye-sub devices like the , and the , take four passes to lay down cyan, magenta, and yellow ink and a clear coat that helps colors stand out and protects images from dust and fingerprints.,As for the IVY 2 Mini, it comes in two colors, white and pink, as shown below.,As I've pointed out before, the size of these pocket photo machines is determined primarily by the size of their print media. The IVY 2 Mini, for instance, measures 0.8 by 3.3 by 4.7 inches and weighs 5.6 pounds, nearly identical to the previous IVY and close to many competitors. Like many of them, this Canon uses 2-by-3-inch paper, as do the abovementioned Kodak Step and Polaroid Hi-Print, as well as the , (not to be confused with the ,, which uses 2.3-by-3.4-inch stock).,All pocket printers require you to load consumables—just paper for Zink printers, paper and an ink cartridge for dye-subs. You load paper into the IVY 2 Mini by sliding its lid back to reveal a media compartment.,Like its predecessor, the IVY 2 Mini holds 10 blank sheets. Printed photos exit via an output slot on the left edge of the machine. On the opposite edge you'll find a USB-C port for charging the printer's battery, a charge-status LED, a reset pinhole, and the power button.,As mentioned, the Canon prints 2-by-3-inch photos with adhesive backs, as well as small circular stickers. (We'll take a closer look at consumables and costs per print in a minute.) Connectivity is limited to the Bluetooth peer-to-peer wireless protocol, and the bundled software supports only iOS or Android handheld devices. Neither this nor the original IVY can connect to a laptop or desktop PC.,You can, however, access several cloud and social media sites, including Facebook, Google Cloud, Instagram, and OneDrive. You pair the IVY 2 Mini to your phone or tablet through the latter's Bluetooth control panel. Print resolution is 313 by 512 dots per inch (dpi), and photos are borderless.,Canon's Mini Print App is a full-featured print driver and photo editing and enhancement program. With it, you can print from your phone's photo album or your favorite cloud and social media sites.,In addition to letting you crop images, correct flaws such as red eye, and adjust contrast and brightness, the app enables you to add text, decorative frames and borders, and other enhancements. A feature unique to the Mini Print App is tiling or joining multiple prints at their edges to create larger images or collages. To compose these larger images, the software simply cuts the image into four or nine 2-by-3-inch pieces that you stick back together after they print.,As I said about the original IVY (which offered only four-tile images) back in 2018, tiling is one feature that helps the Canon stand out from its competitors.,Canon says printing a photo with the IVY 2 Mini takes 50 seconds or less, which is in line with the minute or less taken by nearly every 2-by-3-inch (or thereabouts) pocket photo printer I've tried lately. The first IVY averaged 44 seconds per print, which is actually a little faster than the 48 seconds I averaged with the new model. ,Frankly, anything under 60 seconds is fine for this category; 48 seconds is actually relatively quick, though the Kodak Mini 3 Retro wins the race at 43 seconds per print. (I ran my tests from a Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone with the latest version of Android.) It's important to note that many things, including the resolution and size of the image, and the speed of your phone and its Bluetooth connection, can affect a pocket printer's performance.,As mentioned, one of our gripes about the first Canon IVY was that its print quality wasn't up to snuff compared to its rivals at the time. Happily, the IVY 2 Mini delivers brighter and more intense hues, not to mention better color accuracy and improved detail. Zink technology has improved significantly over the past few years; this Canon's image quality, while still not quite as impressive as prints from similarly sized dye-sublimation devices, is comparable to most of its competitors'.,And as I said, the unique tiling feature allows you to create collages, larger images, or both by breaking an image into four or nine pieces. I don't know of another pocket photo printer that can do that.,At this writing, the IVY 2 Mini's discounted price of $99.99 included the printer, a USB Type-A-to-C charging cable, and 10 sheets of 2-by-3-inch, sticky-backed Zink paper. Since the printer hasn't been on the market long, I didn't find many bundles containing additional paper and other scrapbook material such as the Kodak Step offers, though I did find a few bargains. For $12.99, you can get 20 sheets with two round stickers per sheet, and additional 2-by-3-inch media—whether you buy 20, 50, or 100 sheets at $9.99, $24.99, or $49.99 respectively—will cost you 50 cents per photo. Shopping around might save you a few pennies; I found a 50-pack of paper for $22.99 instead of $24.99, for instance.,Our only gripe about the 2018 Canon IVY Mini was that its prints showed understated or somewhat inaccurate colors and fuzzier details versus rivals from HP, Liene, Kodak, and others. When it comes to imaging, it's highly unusual for Canon to miss the mark, even by a little, so it's good to see the IVY 2 Mini catch up to its competitors. That just leaves the issue of the gadget's slightly higher list price, which you may consider is offset by its image-tiling option. Either way, you won't go wrong with the IVY 2 Mini if quick little snap prints from your phone are what you're after.,Canon's improved IVY 2 Mini prints good-looking photos and stickers at competitive running costs, making it an excellent smartphone companion for little on-the-go pics.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Bowers & Wilkins Pi5 S2 Review,"Stylish but pricey earbuds with accurate sound and few extras,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,Bowers & Wilkins' expensive Pi5 S2 true wireless earphones sound excellent, but lag behind the competition with unremarkable noise cancellation and a bare-bones companion app.,Believe it or not, the $299 Bowers & Wilkins Pi5 S2 , are the more affordable entry in the company's new , lineup. They don't boast a dual-driver setup like the $399 ,, but they still produce crisp audio. We’re also fans of the elegant design, which benefits from a modest level of dust and water resistance. Unfortunately, the active noise cancellation (ANC) isn’t as effective as we expect for the price and the companion app has very few useful features. If you're planning on spending $300 for your next wireless earbuds, both the , ($249) and the , ($299) offer far superior noise cancellation and more customization options.,Available in dark gray, light gray, light green, or lavender, the Pi5 S2 earpieces use a sleek combination of matte plastic and metallic elements. They ship with three pairs of silicone eartips (small, medium, and large) and feel comfortable. Inside the enclosures, 9.2mm dynamic drivers deliver the audio, but frequency range information wasn't available as of this writing.,The earphones are compatible with Bluetooth 5.0, which is a bit out of date. That's noteworthy because Bowers & Wilkins still hasn’t nailed the pairing process. Most earbuds we test enter pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case, but these require you to press a button on the case for 1.5 seconds to initiate the first-time pairing process. In testing, it took us multiple tries to initially pair them with an iPhone, an annoyance we don't expect from any product we test, let alone one that costs this much. The good news is that subsequent connection attempts worked fine. ,The earphones work with the AAC, AptX, and SBC ,. Unlike the pricier Pi7 S2, they lack AptX HD and AptX Adaptive support. In this price range, Sony's $279.99 , earphones are our top choice for , because they work with the hi-res capable LDAC codec. ,Capacitive touch panels on the outside of each earpiece handle the controls. Tap on either earbud to manage playback and calls. Tap twice to skip forward a track or three times to go to the previous one. Press and hold for one second to toggle between the ANC and ambient (Passthrough) modes on the left earpiece. The same gesture on the right earbud summons your device's voice assistant. The layout is fairly intuitive, but it's still easy to accidentally play or pause music when you simply mean to adjust the in-ear fit—a common issue with this type of control setup.,An , is fairly modest but typical for the category. The first digit (5) means the earphones can resist dust ingress to a high degree. But the second digit (4) means they can withstand only light splashes of water from any direction. They should be fine in light rain and for sweaty workouts, but they won't survive submersion or a rinse under a faucet. The rating doesn't apply to the charging case, so make sure to fully dry the earpieces before your dock them.,The round, slightly bulky charging case has a flip-top lid that reveals the charging docks and the aforementioned pairing button. We found it slightly difficult to remove the earpieces from the case because they don't offer much surface area to grasp and the dock's magnets are relatively strong. A USB-C port on the bottom works with the included USB-C-to-USB-C charging cable, but you don't get a USB-A adapter. The case also supports any Qi ,.,Bowers & Wilkins estimates that the earbuds can last roughly five hours per charge with ANC off and that the case holds an additional 19 hours of battery. Of course, your results will vary based on your volume level and use of ANC. These numbers aren't very impressive, but the company at least claims that 15 minutes of charging gets you two hours of music playback.,Note that the Bowers & Wilkins Music app (available for Android and iOS) is the one you should use for these earphones, not the B&W Headphones app. The main screen shows an image of the earpieces, along with a battery life readout for each one (but not the case). The first time you open the app, a setup guide walks you through the basics of the on-ear controls. ,The app design is very straightforward and clean, but the experience is remarkably light on actual features. You don't get an ,, the ability to fine-tune the ANC experience, or the option to customize the control layout. There is a section that lets you choose between low, high, or off options for the Passthrough mode, but, confusingly, the app doesn't prevent you from leaving both the ANC and ambient mode active simultaneously. That seems counterintuitive, and a far more elegant solution would be to allow the user to cycle through ANC, ambient, and all-off modes like with most other models we test. ,Otherwise, you can toggle wear detection, adjust the streaming quality (standard, medium, high, and highest), and rename the product. You can also update the software and sign into any linked services such as Deezer, Qobuz, and Tidal, for in-app media controls.,Overall, this app is severely lacking in features. We implore Bowers & Wilkins to take a long look at its competitors’ apps that offer much more in the way of customization. It’s a weak spot for this product, as it means you can't do much to change the out-of-box experience.,The Pi5 S2 earphones performed slightly above average in our noise cancellation tests. They substantially dialed back powerful low-frequency rumble like you hear on an airplane, but they added an audible hiss to the signal, which is generally something that premium models avoid. In fact, in a quiet room with no audio playing, the ANC mode raised the noise floor, effectively accentuating it. ,When we played a recording of a busy restaurant with clanging dishes and boisterous conversation from nearby speakers, the earphones somewhat cut back the noise, but not to a notable degree. In the same tests, the AirPods Pro and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II made the recordings barely audible. If you think of the noise cancellation here as more of a bonus feature than a major selling point, you might enjoy it, but for the price, you should really be getting top-of-the-line performance.,On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” the earphones deliver a powerful low-frequency response that leans toward accuracy. The higher-register frequencies have a little less sculpting than usual as well. We didn't hear any distortion at maximum volume levels, and the bass depth still feels robust at moderate volumes.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the sound signature. The drums on this track get some extra rumble, but they sound mostly natural and large, not overly bass-heavy. Callahan’s baritone vocals receive a pleasant low-mid richness, while the highs and high-mids are crisp enough to lend the entire mix sufficient definition. That said, some people might want more of an emphasis in the high-mids and highs—the signature focuses slightly on the lows and low-mids. Overall, it’s a natural, warm sound, but those who seek pinpoint accuracy or the ability to make any tweaks need to look elsewhere.,The drivers have no trouble reproducing the sub-bass tones at the 34-second mark of Kendrick Lamar’s “Loyalty.” The sub-bass synth elements get progressively deeper, but even the lowest notes sound full. The various vocal performances come across clearly and never contend for space with the deep bass. Again, however, some people might prefer a bit more crispness. ,The lows in orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, get some boosting, but never to the point that they overtake the mix. In fact, some people might even appreciate the additional body in the lower-register instrumentation. The higher-register brass, strings, and vocals still sound plenty bright and naturally stand out in tracks like this.,The four-mic array works very well and presents voices cleanly. We didn't have any trouble understanding every word from a test recording on an iPhone, though the signal was just slightly faint compared with that on many other high-end models we've tested.,The elegant Bowers & Wilkins Pi5 S2 earphones deliver strong audio, but it’s difficult to look past the somewhat average ANC and the underwhelming app experience at this price. The earphones just don’t bring enough features to the table compared with others in the segment, and at the very least, Bowers & Wilkins needs to let users tweak the sound to their preference. Most people who have $300 to spend on wireless earbuds should get the AirPods Pro or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II because of their first-rate ANC and greater customizability. And if you want the absolute best audio quality over Bluetooth, we recommend the Sony WF-1000XM4.,Bowers & Wilkins' expensive Pi5 S2 true wireless earphones sound excellent, but lag behind the competition with unremarkable noise cancellation and a bare-bones companion app.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Philips Fidelio FB1 Review,"Spatial audio and sculpted sound,I’ve been PCMag’s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).,The Philips Fidelio FB1 soundbar pushes out serious bass without a dedicated subwoofer and spreads decent spatial audio around the room., are becoming an increasingly feasible way to add spatial audio to your TV without scattering satellites around your living room. The Philips Fidelio FB1 ($699.99), for instance, features Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and 7.1.2 channels built into its unobtrusive form. Its spatial imaging performance doesn’t quite match the , ($499.99), though it does a much better job of delivering bass. That said, the , remains our Editors' Choice winner for high-end all-in-one soundbars. Although it costs more at $899, it offers a more balanced sound signature than the Fidelio FB1 and the ability to double as a , via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.,The FB1 is a large but unassuming soundbar. It’s a simple 2.9-by-47.2-by-4.9-inch (HWD) black plank covered on the front, sides, and top with a matte black metal grille. An indicator LED and a white alphanumeric LED sit behind the front grille. A rubber rectangle positioned in the middle of the top panel holds input, play/pause, power, volume up, and volume down buttons. The two upward-firing drivers under the top grille are surrounded by LED rings, which can be enabled or disabled using the remote.,The back of the soundbar features a bass port, a small recess with a connector for the power cable, and a larger recess with the rest of the wired connections. There’s HDMI for connecting to the TV over eARC, HDMI pass-through, optical audio, USB, a 2.5mm port (for IR blaster), a 3.5mm port (for microphone probe), and a Wi-Fi pairing button.,The included remote is a rectangular black plastic wand with a matte, brushed finish and a trapezoidal profile. A large, square pad sits near the top and controls volume and navigates the soundbar’s settings. Power, input, and mute buttons sit above the pad, while back, Dolby Atmos, EQ, settings, and sound mode buttons can be found below it.,Connecting via the HDMI eARC port will enable the best sound, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X spatial audio, but the FB1 also has a wide selection of wireless options. There’s Bluetooth with support for the SBC and AAC ,, plus Apple AirPlay 2, but not Google Cast. The soundbar also has DTS Play-Fi, DTS’ own wireless speaker ecosystem that integrates easily with AirPlay on iOS devices and has dedicated Android, iOS, and Windows apps. iOS, iPadOS, and Windows users can stream audio wirelessly to the FB1. Android users will find a more limited in-app experience, with support for Amazon Music, SiriusXM, Spotify, and Tidal, but not Apple Music or YouTube Music. Play-Fi also enables multi-room audio systems with other Play-Fi-compatible speakers.,The FB1 is a 7.1.2-channel, one-piece soundbar system. The left, right, and center channels each have two full-range drivers and a tweeter, while the two side-firing and two height channels have single full-range drivers. The 3.5-inch subwoofer is integrated inside the chassis; it’s larger than typical full-range soundbar drivers but smaller than the generally eight- to 10-inch drivers found in standalone subwoofers.,Even without a subwoofer, the FB1 can put out some impressive sub-bass. The kick drum hits in our bass test track, The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” get some serious thunder, providing palpable thump that shook my entertainment center at higher volume levels. It might not rattle the walls like a full-sized subwoofer, but it will certainly annoy the neighbors if you live in an apartment building. Oddly, the bass synth notes at the start of the track aren’t nearly as strong, and sound a bit distant compared with the drum hits. It indicates either a frequency crossover between the full-range drivers and woofer, or perhaps an atypical low-end response curve.,Yes’ “Roundabout” sounds excellent on the FB1. The opening acoustic guitar plucks get plenty of low-end resonance and the delicate string textures come through clearly in the higher frequencies. When the track properly kicks in, the bassline sounds full with a strong attack that gives it a punchy edge. The drums and guitar strums also stand out, though the vocals settle just slightly behind them rather than sharing the spotlight. It’s a purposefully sculpted sound that focuses attention on the extremes rather than providing balance in the low-mids and high-mids. It’s a pleasant, clean, and powerful sound.,The FB1 is supposed to help you tweak the spatial audio features to suit your room by running a calibration test that processes each channel to determine the best level. I had no problem running the calibration test itself, but each time the test concluded, the FB1 stopped delivering sound entirely and had to be reset. Philips confirmed to PCMag that this is a known issue and that a planned firmware update will hopefully rectify the problem. Until Philips issues the patch, the FB1’s auto-calibration feature will likely not work. That’s not a good start.,Without calibration, the FB1 still puts out solid spatial imaging. The Dolby Atmos audio in , is full and detailed, with the opening chase and fight scenes pushing plenty of low-frequency rumble that vibrated my floor. Higher frequencies are crunchy as rubble flies around, and dialogue is clear throughout the action. The audio profile still sounds a bit scooped, but it puts out a large, bombastic sound field.,Directional imaging is accurate, if a bit modest. I can hear the general direction of rocks and cars smashing around through the soundbar, and its stereo panning is excellent. The height channels create a bigger sense of dimension with the film, though specific objects flying overhead aren’t quite as distinct as they are with the Bose Smart Soundbar 600.,The 5.1-channel audio of , also sounds full and clear, with voices pushing through with presence and detail. The sound of a knife tapping against a whiskey glass resonates with a sharp, punchy ring followed by a round, lingering tone. The soundtrack easily fills a room, keeping every element present.,The Philips Fidelio FB1 is a capable one-piece soundbar that’s loaded with features and can thump out some serious bass without a separate subwoofer. Its spatial audio imaging isn’t quite as accurate as some competitors, like the Bose Smart Soundbar 600 or the much more expensive, ($1,899.99) with its height-equipped rear surrounds, but it offers a good mix of performance for the price. It’s comparable with the Sonos Arc in sound quality, though with more aggressively sculpted audio. Ultimately, we like the Arc more for its general audio balance and its ability to double as an Amazon or Google smart speaker.,The Philips Fidelio FB1 soundbar pushes out serious bass without a dedicated subwoofer and spreads decent spatial audio around the room.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Apple macOS Ventura Review,"The most enjoyable and productive OS there is,Ventura is a worthy upgrade to Apple's fast, reliable, and elegant macOS, with improvements that help you focus, use your phone as a webcam, find things more easily in email, and much more., Just about every Mac user will be happy with macOS Ventura, the latest version of Apple's desktop and laptop ,, available as a free download for any compatible Mac. Happy, yes, but no one will be especially excited, which is why Ventura is exactly the kind of upgrade a smooth, elegant operating system like macOS should get. The most visible new feature is Stage Manager, which lets you focus on one or two apps with fewer distractions. Apple adds dozens of smaller changes and improvements, plus a few interface changes that make macOS more consistent with iPhones and iPads. There's still room for improvement, but Ventura makes the case that macOS is the most enjoyable and productive OS overall, as well as a PCMag Editors' Choice winner.,Since our initial review, the OS has received two point updates, 13.1 and 13.2. The first added a completely new collaborative whiteboard-style app called Freeform. The second's major contribution is support for hardware security keys like the ,, something that's been available in Windows for several years.,Unlike last year's ,, Ventura doesn't confront you with a major overhaul to the interface. Instead, it improves the operating system's look, feel, and security, and it adds flexible new features like a family-shared photo library in Photos. Ventura continues Apple's push to integrate iOS and macOS. For example, you can now use your iPhone as your Mac's webcam, a feature called Continuity Camera. To make it work effortlessly, Apple is selling a $29.95 mounting bracket by Belkin that snaps onto your laptop, though it's not required. You also get new security features like ,, a secure login method that's an alternative to passwords.,Now that we're at the second point release, version 13.2, it's probably safe to go ahead and update your Mac to the new OS version, though there's always the possibility that something won't work after updating (as you'll see if you peruse Apple's support forums). If you want to try out Ventura without risking any changes to the system you use daily, use the macOS Disk Utility app to create a new volume on your hard disk and call it Ventura—or anything else you'll remember. (Note that you need about 50GB of disk space.) Next, download macOS Ventura from the App Store and run it. Be extremely careful when clicking on the prompts to avoid upgrading your existing system! When the installer prompts you to install Ventura on your current system, which is probably named Macintosh HD, click the button that says Show All Disks (don't skip this essential step). Then carefully choose to install Ventura on your new volume instead of one with your existing system.,When Ventura starts up for the first time, you can choose the option to transfer your settings, and—if you have room for them—your applications, from your existing disk. If you don't have room to copy your apps, you can probably run them from the Applications folder in your old system. While you're trying out Ventura, you can switch back to Monterey by selecting its volume in the System Preference's Startup Disk pane. (I explain in a moment how to find that pane in Ventura's revamped System Preferences app.),Later, when you're ready to upgrade your existing system, choose Software Update on your Monterey system, and let it update your Monterey setup to Ventura. When you no longer need the Ventura volume you were using for testing, use the Disk Utility app to delete its partition—but only after you've made sure you've safely copied any documents you created in that test partition.,Ventura runs on almost any Mac released in the past five years. It works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Ventura supports:,iMac 2017 and later,Mac Pro 2019 and later,iMac Pro 2017,Mac Studio 2022,MacBook Air 2018 and later,Mac mini 2018 and later,MacBook Pro 2017 and later,MacBook 2017,A simple way to tell is that if your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air dates back to 2015 and uses the old MagSafe connector, it won't run Ventura. Similarly, the 2017 MacBook Air with the old connector can't run Ventura. If you're in doubt, check ,. ,Ventura has two visually spectacular enhancements, but you'll only see them if you look for them. One is the new Stage Manager feature, which helps you focus on one app (adding one or more other apps if you want them) while moving everything else out of the way. The other is the Continuity Camera feature, which lets you , instead of the low-tech camera in your Mac. ,Let's start with ,. This feature, which is also available on many iPad models, is a clever addition to the anti-distraction features already in the Focus feature in macOS and iOS that limits interruptions while you're working or sleeping. When you click on the Stage Manager icon in the Control Center, the app you're working in moves to the center of the screen. Any other open apps shrink to a stack of icons on the left and apps and folders on your desktop disappear entirely, though you can set an option that keeps them visible. Drag the current app to the left, and the stack of icons for your other open apps disappears also—or you can make the other app icons disappear by default. If you drag one of the open app icons into the window with the current app, you can keep both open, with everything else remaining invisible or icon-ized.,Apple has been improving focus in recent macOS and iOS versions, and Stage Manager is the best improvement yet. It extends the existing subtle feature that grays out the main window of an app when you open a sub-window to print or set preferences. Like other interface features, you can start Stage Manager either by clicking its menu bar icon or by setting a hotkey that toggles it on and off. You can't start it from a desktop Hot Corner, but you can hope Apple will add that option someday. Stage Manager isn't perfect. I wish Apple hadn't indulged its taste for razzle-dazzle graphics by reducing inactive apps to icons with a distracting perspective effect so that they look as if they've been turned 45 degrees to the left and seem to recede into the background. When it comes to windows arrangement, Apple still has some catching up to do with Windows.,Continuity Camera is Ventura's other dazzling interface feature. Last year, Apple introduced the Sidecar feature that lets you use an iPad as a second display for your Mac and move the mouse or files between the two devices. This year, with Continuity Camera, your iPhone running iOS 16 works effortlessly as a superior alternative to your Mac's webcam, and wirelessly. ,It helps to have a stand to prop up your phone, so you may want to buy the aforementioned Belkin clip that attaches to the top of your screen and grips your phone magnetically (though it's not required). The stand also works as a kickstand for your phone. Belkin says it will release a similar stand for desktops and standalone monitors soon. If you buy one of these stands, don't make the beginner mistake I did when I tried to attach my phone without removing its protective case; the magnet only grips the stand when it makes direct contact with the phone's surface. When your phone is on the stand, your Mac automatically switches from its built-in camera to the phone's camera, but drop-down menus in apps with camera support let you choose the built-in camera if you prefer. This feature worked seamlessly in ,, Skype, and FaceTime, and it's an excellent example of how macOS at its best just works. ,The Continuity Camera feature includes video effects like Center Stage, which tries to keep you in the frame as you move around the room. Portrait Mode blurs the room behind you while keeping your face in focus, a feature familiar to anyone who has used , in the last two years. Studio Light dims the background and highlights your face. This feature also supports Desk View, which uses your phone's ultrawide camera feed to split the window horizontally, showing your face on the left and your desk on the right. I wasn't able to make Desk View work smoothly, but that may be because my phone is a low-end ,. ,Each of these features requires recent phones—some requiring an iPhone 11, some an iPhone 12. Also, it took me a while to figure out that you turn on these features by clicking on the little green light that appears in the Control Center in the top-line menu when the camera is running. Once you figure that out, you won't forget it. ,One last continuity enhancement is the ability to hand off a FaceTime call from a Mac to an iOS device, and vice versa.,FaceTime also gets a Live Captioning feature (labeled beta as of this writing) in the preferences pane where you can turn it on. After turning it on, wait for the OS to download a large language pack, and then you may or may not be happy with the results. In my informal tests, the feature ignored many words and misinterpreted others. The friend I was talking with hadn’t enabled captioning on her iPhone (it’s available in both Ventura and iOS 16) and said, “I don’t see any captions here.” My Mac rendered that as “I don’t see any cats in here.” Like many newly-introduced Apple features, you can expect this one to get a lot better in the future.,A surprising but less spectacular interface change is Ventura's redesigned System Preferences. Instead of a grid of icons, as in all previous versions, you get a sidebar menu on the left, with each item on the menu opening to a preferences pane on the right. The general idea is to make System Settings have a similar menu structure to Settings in iOS. ,Your iCloud and Apple ID settings are at the top, and then you work your way down through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Network, Notifications, and more than 20 additional items, more or less as in iOS. The change that takes the most getting used to is having to use a new menu item named General that leads to controls like Software Update, Time Machine, and Startup Disk, which used to be instantly available in the main window of the old System Preferences app. This new system makes sense, as you're likely to use these controls a lot less often than others, though tinkerers and advanced users will probably mourn the old layout where you didn't need to hunt through a menu for those controls.,In the old System Preferences app, you could go to the Sound panel to find the option to show the volume control in the menu bar, or go to the Bluetooth panel to find the option to show Bluetooth in the menu bar. In a move to make System Preferences more logical, all these options have moved to the panel that manages the Control Center. You can find them easily by typing ""volume"" or ""Bluetooth"" in the app's search field, but I wish Apple had prioritized convenience here.,Apple made a similar interface change to the system-wide Print dialog, but here it's entirely welcome. Previously, if you wanted to scroll through the thumbnail preview images, you had to view them one at a time. The new dialog displays a preview of multiple pages in a thumbnail sidebar like the one in the Preview app. And the options in the main panel of the dialog are easier to manage. Third-party apps like Microsoft Office still use Print dialogs that look like the old macOS dialog, but they will probably change as third-party developers update their apps for Ventura.,Arriving in the 13.1 update to Ventura, Freeform is a digital whiteboard app that lets you brainstorm and collaborate with others. To the borderless whiteboard, you can add drawings, shapes, images, links, stickers, videos, and even files. Everything you do in the app syncs among all invited users on Macs, iPhones, and iPads. ,For collaboration to work, you need to enable iCloud syncing. It's a flexible and interesting app that competes with Google Jamboard and ,, both of which are collaborative and cross-platform.,The big usability enhancements in Ventura are in Mail, Messages, and FaceTime. Mail's search feature gets a major overhaul and is more reliable than in earlier versions, though still not as powerful as it should be. When you click in the search field, a drop-down shows you a list of links and attached documents found in recent messages, because those are the things you're most likely to look for. Searches for names and words are faster than before, and searches now include Google-style synonym searching and autocorrect for mistyped words. ,If you have multiple mailboxes, and you probably do, you'll be grateful for one subtle change: When you start typing a search string, the search goes through all mailboxes by default, so you no longer need to click an option for each. Also, Ventura's mail search seems far more thorough than earlier versions. I used to keep a copy of the Thunderbird mail client on my Mac because Thunderbird's search always found messages macOS Mail couldn't.,Mail finally gets an Undo Send feature that lets you second-guess yourself after going forth with an angry message or wondering if you left a typo in an important email. For 10 seconds after you click Send, an Undo Send button appears at the foot of the Mail sidebar. If you click it, the message-editing window opens so you can either delete your message entirely, or edit it and resend it. ,By clicking and dragging right on a received message, you can click a clock icon that sets a reminder that puts the message back into your inbox on the reminder date. For messages in English, a Follow Up feature detects messages that specifically ask for a response and pushes them to the top of the inbox. Also, as in Thunderbird and other mail clients, Mail finally prompts you if you mention an attachment in your message and then forget to include it.,The Messages app now lets you mark a conversation as unread by right-clicking the conversation or from the top-line menu, although you won't find the option by right-clicking on an ,message. The app continues to add collaboration features, such as the ability to share a document or presentation directly from Messages. When someone joins a Messages thread, you can add them to the collaboration with a click. Deleted messages are now retained for 30 days in case you need to retrieve them, so you no longer need to scour your phone in the hope of finding a message you've deleted from your Mac.,The Messages app plays catch-up with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger by giving you two minutes to unsend a message. You also get 15 minutes to edit it. What seems wrong with this feature is that earlier versions of an edited message remain visible to the recipient, so if you send a message that says ""I quit,"" and then revise it to say ""I look forward to working with you forever,"" the recipient can click a button and see the original version. So, if you've said something you think you might have regretted, you'll definitely want to unsend the message and start over.,This doesn't happen with WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. And unlike in those two apps, you can't hide a message only on your side of the conversation, leaving it visible to the recipient, so that anyone looking over your shoulder won't see your message, but the recipient can., now gets a Shared Library feature you can set up from the app's Preferences and share with family members or anyone else. Members of the sharing group can edit or delete photos in the shared library.,You can set up your phone to save photos directly to the Shared Library instead of to your private library. You can also click on a drop-down in the Photos app to display either your personal library or your shared library, or both at the same time. ,It's a potentially terrific feature, but I have mixed feelings about the way Ventura implements it. In the similar Shared Album feature introduced in earlier versions of macOS and still available, only the user who contributed a photo has the ability to delete or modify it. In the new Shared Library, everyone has equal control, so your little brother can draw a mustache on your selfies, and there's nothing you can do to stop him. Also, the Photos app only lets you ,a photo from one library to the other, not ,from one library to another, so if you want to keep a backup copy before you move a photo to a shared library, make sure to choose Duplicate Photo from the context menu.,The Photos app now stores your recently deleted photos in a separate library, accessible only with a password or Touch ID. And an impressively well-executed Copy Subject feature reminiscent of recent Photoshop capabilities automatically copies the person (or people) in a photo to the clipboard without the background. This means you can paste the resulting image into a message or document. When you select Copy Subject from a photo's pop-up menu, Photos shows you what will be copied by drawing a white outline around the section it selects.,As it does in each new version of the OS, , gets improvements to its organizing features, and, as always, Apple adds more ways to share almost everything with almost everyone. ,Earlier macOS versions added Tab Groups—sets of tabs you can open with a click on the name of the group. Ventura adds shared Tab Groups, so you can send a Tab Group via Messages and then, in real time, see which of your colleagues is viewing which of your tabs. Each Tab Group can get its own start page. If you click on the controls icon at the lower right of the page, you can choose which sections of Safari's default start page will appear on the group's start page. You can apply a background image either chosen from a gallery provided by Apple or by selecting an image of your own; a plus sign button makes it possible. None of these features is especially intuitive to figure out, but you only have to try it once to get the idea.,The biggest security enhancement involves ,, a new kind of credential that combines a biometric identification like Touch ID or Face ID with an encrypted digital key that's stored, in this case, on your Mac and propagated to all your other devices via your iCloud Keychain. Passkeys are touted as a much safer alternative to the standard username and password combos for logins. Passkey isn't exclusive to Apple, but Ventura marks the first release of it on macOS.,Passkeys only work on websites that support them, but they should make digital life far more secure than it is now, partly because passkeys can't be phished and they only work from your own devices. If you log in to a supported website from a Windows or Android device, the site displays a QR code that, when scanned, lets you log in from your iPhone.,Other password improvements include the ability to edit Safari's suggested strong passwords to match a website's login requirements and easy access to Wi-Fi passwords via the Network Settings panel, where you can click to copy a password to share it.,At PCMag, we often stress the importance of enabling , (MFA), and hardware keys like those in the YubiKey line are some of the strongest forms of MFA available. With the 13.2 update to Ventura, you can now require a hardware security key to log in to your Apple ID account on your Mac. You need two ,-certified keys for this to work, according to ,—read our roundup of , for help selecting one.,Ventura brings to the Mac features you take for granted on your phone. For example, a new Clock app works like a spacious version of the iOS equivalent. You can create alarms and set a time or stopwatch. A new Weather app is an equally spacious version of the iOS app and opens all the locations you've added on your phone. The existing Reminders app gets the ability to pin lists in the same way you can pin conversations in the Messages app. You can also create templates for new lists and see all your completed tasks in a single list.,Ventura, like Monterey, lets you install many apps designed for the iPad but, as the App Store warns, ""not verified for macOS."" I am disappointed Ventura doesn't let me resize these apps, but it seems that Apple is respecting the settings made by the app developers for the iOS and iPadOS versions. If, like me, you've been reaching for your phone for apps that you don't have on your Mac, search for those apps in the macOS App Store, because you may find them there. ,Speaking of the apps, I'm still waiting for Apple to improve the App Store so I can search in my list of purchased apps, or at least display that list in alphabetical order instead of in reverse order of purchase date, which makes it impossible to find the app I'm looking for.,The Spotlight search feature gets an unusually hefty set of enhancements. You can finally open a Quick Look preview simply by pressing the spacebar, just as you could already do from the Finder. Spotlight now returns a more extensive set of search hits; for example, search for ""clock"" and the result list includes ""create timer."" ,A Rich Results feature displays a screen of information about performers, artists, businesses, and more, and also about your contacts, so you can enter a contact's name and see their birthday and other information without opening the Contacts app. When a Rich Result is available, the Spotlight search field says Show More, and you simply press Enter to see the information. If you search for something like ""house photos,"" Apple claims you'll find photos of your house in the Photos app, but I had very mixed success with this feature, which found only a few of the dozens of house photos in my library. ,As in previous versions, some Ventura features won't be ready at the first release, and Apple says only that they're coming ""later this year."" The most notable one is Freeform, an infinite-canvas collaboration app along the lines of ,, ,, Google's JamBoard, Zoom's built-in Whiteboard, and others. It isn't available for testing, but it looks as if its major advantage will be its integration into the Apple ecosystem, so you'll be able to start a collaboration from FaceTime or see updates in Messages.,Apple says everything in Ventura runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, with the one exception of the above-mentioned Live Captions feature, which provides real-time transcriptions of calls and FaceTime calls and runs only on Apple Silicon. By contrast, Live Captions in Windows 11 work on all PCs. Earlier macOS versions had larger lists of features that required Apple Silicon, and my guess is that Apple's decision to support Ventura only on post-2015-era Macs means all Intel Macs that can support Ventura are powerful enough to run almost all its features. Apple reports that its Metal 3 graphics technology will enhance speed and visual detail in games, but I haven't tested it.,That doesn't mean Ventura gives me everything I want from macOS. I've been begging Apple for years to provide an option to use darker folder icons than the glaringly bright blue ones. If you switch the interface to Dark Mode, the edges of the folder darken slightly, but the folders are still too bright. Until a few years ago, I was able to change the default icons by hand, but security updates in recent versions make it impossible. ,I still can't find a way to drag a System Preferences pane to the desktop or a folder to create a shortcut, and I wish macOS, like Windows, would let me compare creation dates and other details when I copy a file into a folder where another version of the same file already exists. ,I also wish every macOS dialog box would let me navigate its buttons and options from the keyboard, instead of leaving me guessing whether I'll need to use the mouse to select the button I want. All these are minor long-standing complaints about macOS, not specifically about Ventura.,I'm writing this review while traveling with two laptops, a , running Ventura and a , running ,, and Ventura helps me to focus and relax in ways Windows 11 doesn't. Of course, some of my PCMag colleagues have exactly the opposite opinion, and I'll continue to rely on Windows for running apps that aren't as feature-rich or convenient in their Mac versions. But except when I need those few apps, I'll always reach for my Mac first. ,In our testing, Ventura has consistently proven itself to be swift, reliable, and elegant, with deep security features no other OS can match. Ventura is a smooth, straightforward upgrade, and a clear Editors' Choice winner that confirms macOS is the most polished operating system overall. ,Ventura is a worthy upgrade to Apple's fast, reliable, and elegant macOS, with improvements that help you focus, use your phone as a webcam, find things more easily in email, and much more.,Sign up for our , for the latest news, reviews, tips, and more delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Acer Aspire C24-1700 AIO Review,"A decent budget desktop in a monitor-only footprint,In undergrad I was the guy you’d run to if you needed a charge, because I always had at least a few portable batteries in my bag at all times. A lifelong interest in technology has led me to PCMag, where I hope to hone my journalism skills while also getting to nerd out about the latest advancements in computer tech. I’m a current PC gamer and a former console gamer, slowly biding my time until the chip shortage is over.,A decent-performing AIO budget desktop, Acer's Aspire C24-1700 needs a screen-quality and feature-set infusion to rise into the top ranks.,An ,'s appeal is hard to ignore. An AIO is ideal if you want the stability of a desktop computer but need as much desk space as possible. Since AIOs have no PC tower, they take up only the space a monitor would in a normal desktop configuration. At $649.99, the Acer Aspire C24-1700 makes the most of its space in subtle ways, like the inclusion of wireless peripherals and a wide monitor base. It needs some creature comforts, though: This system could use ports that are more easily accessible, and a higher-quality screen to properly achieve the usefulness of the AIO design. While we appreciate the competitive performance that this Acer AIO displays, it's not quite the full package that the Editors' Choice-award-winning , delivers.,The Acer Aspire’s monitor doubles as the housing for all the components that power the desktop PC: an Intel Core i3-1215U CPU, 8GB of RAM (Acer’s documentation mentions it’s expandable to 32GB), and a 512GB solid state drive. The PC comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Home, along with a variety of associated Acer bloatware.,The Core i3-1215U processor is a low-power-consumption chip most commonly found in laptops, though this is not uncommon among AIOs that value size. Even high-performance AIOs, like the ,, use laptop components, like the Core i7-7820HQ processor, for their compactness.,What the Aspire lacks in high-end specs it makes up for in its utilization of space. At its lengthiest point, the base of the desktop monitor extends no more than 7 inches, and its included wireless mouse and keyboard ensure no wires get in the way of a clean-looking desktop surface.,The monitor itself is a 23.8-inch, 1080p LED screen housed within an all-black plastic frame that articulates up and down. The monitor has a pair of integrated, downward-facing speakers that are loud enough to produce a slight, but noticeable, rattle. The integrated webcam above the screen records video at 1080p, and the physical privacy shutter slides easily between its off and on positions. This AIO has no optical drive, but that’s also how the whole housing can be so thin.,The back of the Acer Aspire is where you’ll find most of the ports you’ll need access to. There’s a USB 3.2 Type-C port, an HDMI output, Ethernet and audio jacks, and a barrel-style AC power port.,The wireless keyboard and mouse are paired to a single USB receiver, which makes connecting them as easy as connecting it to one of the three USB ports on the back and forgetting it. Both the keyboard and mouse are powered by pre-installed AAA batteries, and there are no connection ports on either of them. The small mouse has a simple on/off switch on the bottom, and the keyboard is always active, with no option to cut power other than removing a battery.,Bundling in peripherals is always a necessity with an AIO—otherwise, it's not truly ""all-in-one."" The included keyboard is slim and provides a decent typing experience, although it's maybe too thin, showing considerable flex due to its mostly plastic construction. The mouse is quite small, which is a pro for putting it out of the way but a con if you have larger hands.,A single USB Type-A port sits underneath the bottom ridge of the monitor in a recessed pocket. This is your main port for any storage devices or extra peripherals. Seeing as this is the only front-facing port, we’d recommend figuring out what accessories you need plugged in before finalizing a placement for the system.,For our test comparisons, we aimed to place the Acer Aspire alongside similarly priced AIOs like the ,, our Editors' Choice in 2021 for AIOs. We're also comparing it with the ,, with its optical drive and pop-up webcam. Last, we’ve reviewed both the , and its Intel-based counterpart, the ,, the latter which recently received our Editors’ Choice award in the budget AIO category.,We use a number of benchmarks in testing all desktop PCs. PCMark 10 measures overall performance by simulating a number of real-world productivity tasks that can be expected from daily use: editing spreadsheets, word processing, web browsing, video conferencing, and more. Along with that general performance test, PCMark 10 has a storage benchmark to measure a system’s ability to load and write data from storage.,To test CPU performance more thoroughly, we use a number of programs to simulate CPU-heavy tasks. Handbrake measures a system’s ability to convert a 4K video file to 1080p—to ensure accurate tests, we always use the same video file: Blender’s , short demo film. Maxon’s Cinebench renders a complex scene using the company’s 4D engine, and Geekbench works similarly to PCMark 10’s general tests, but measuring more CPU-intensive workloads one after another. We also run Puget Systems’ PugetBench for Photoshop benchmark to test its content creation capabilities.,Acer's Aspire C24 earns a passing grade in our CPU tests; it has the most current processor hardware on this list. Despite this, the AIO just barely passes our 4,000 score minimum in PCMark 10’s general benchmark, but still outperforms all our other systems in the test. This AIO is also the fastest at converting our 4K video file in HandBrake, and it comes out on top in Geekbench’s productivity tests, as well as in Cinebench’s render test, drastically outperforming the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 3, which places second in both. (Acer can thank the wealth of Efficient cores added to the Core i3 in the AIO for that Cinebench showing.),Unfortunately, the Acer Aspire underperforms in PCMark 10’s storage test and our Photoshop benchmark, well behind its nearest competitors. (The Ryzen 3/SSD combo in the IdeaCentre AIO 3, and the 16GB of RAM in the IdeaCentre AIO 3i, likely gained them their Photoshop triumphs.) So, don't come to this AIO expecting to get serious photo editing work done.,We run a number of tests on our systems to gauge graphical performance. The 3DMark benchmarking suite’s Time Spy subtest is designed for computers with dedicated GPUs, and the Night Raid subtest is better suited for systems that use integrated graphics. We also run two tests in GFXBench that test low-level routines, like texture mapping, and high-level ones, like image rendering: 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase.,Most of these systems weren’t able to run Time Spy or 1440p Aztec Ruins. Time Spy is meant for systems with dedicated GPUs, and thus is more stable in that environment. It didn't complete on the Acer, and trying to run Aztec Ruins ended up crashing the program altogether, so both were left out of our charts below.,With what benchmarks the Acer Aspire ,run, we saw typical graphical performance for the integrated graphics on the 12th Gen Core processor in this housing. The Aspire scores well higher than the Lenovo IdeaCentre 3 in both Night Raid and Car Chase, which is impressive. While you shouldn't expect to play , on this Aspire AIO (or really on any of these machines), for low-level graphics performance, the Acer Aspire would be your best bet for smaller tasks.,We use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite calibration tool to test display performance. For regular desktops, we wouldn’t need to test this, as you’d supply whatever monitor you own, but since part of the appeal of an AIO is the integrated monitor, we included the test.,We measure color-gamut coverage as well as brightness levels (in nits) at 50% and 100% settings. The Acer Aspire achieves 99% coverage of the sRGB palette, 77% of Adobe RGB, and 78% of DCI-P3, a decent color-coverage showing that should suffice for most casual use. In terms of brightness, the monitor reaches only 111 nits at 50% brightness and just 209 nits at 100%—even some budget laptops we've tested hit higher marks than these, on average. It's notably dim.,The Acer Aspire C24-1700 does what it needs to out of the box. For $649.99, you get a desktop PC, a monitor, and wireless peripherals—and it can be set up in under 10 minutes once you’ve cleared space for it. However, this simplicity is not unique to this AIO. It may pack a bit more performance than other systems in this price range, but a true AIO should do it all, and strike an effective balance among usability, performance, and design. ,While the Acer Aspire doesn't completely wow us, it could be a smart pickup if you see it on sale. Otherwise, we recommend a configuration of the Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 3i (kitted with enough RAM) as the best budget AIO we've tested in recent months.,A decent-performing AIO budget desktop, Acer's Aspire C24-1700 needs a screen-quality and feature-set infusion to rise into the top ranks.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

HP Dragonfly Folio G3 Review,"A costly but classy 2-in-1 laptop for stylus-minded business managers,I was picked to write the ""20 Most Influential PCs"" feature for PCMag's 40th Anniversary coverage because I remember them all—I started on a TRS-80 magazine in 1982 and served as editor of , when it was a 700-page monthly. I was later the editor in chief of ,, a magazine that promoted using tech to work from home two decades before a pandemic made it standard practice. Even in semiretirement in Bradenton, Florida, I can't stop playing with toys and telling people what gear to buy.,A plush cover and an unusual pull-forward convertible design set HP's Dragonfly Folio G3 apart from most lightweight corporate 2-in-1s.,No, it's not real leather—it's polyurethane—but the textured covering of the lid makes the HP Dragonfly Folio G3 (starts at $2,379; $2,749 as tested) comfy to carry and satisfying to see. This , variant of HP's flagship lightweight , family is a swank status symbol for executives who combine scribbling and sketching with keyboard input, with goodies ranging from 5G mobile broadband to a deluxe 8-megapixel conferencing camera. It's unabashedly expensive and heavier than the 2.2-pound ,, a clamshell design with the same 13.5-inch, 3:2-aspect-ratio display, but still, the Folio earns an Editors' Choice nod among high-end business convertibles.,HP's $2,379 base model of the Folio G3 carries a 12th Generation Core i7-1255U , with the Intel vPro manageability technology beloved by IT departments, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive. Its IPS touch screen has a 1,920-by-1,280-pixel resolution. Our $2,749 review unit runs on the same basic specs but a fractionally faster Core i7-1265U CPU (two Performance cores, eight Efficient cores, 12 threads) and Intel 5G connectivity for use where there are no hotspots for its , networking. Windows 11 Pro and a two-button stylus are standard.,It's a fact that business laptops cost more than comparably equipped civilian notebooks. In the Dragonfly Folio's case, you're paying for not only vPro but HP's cutting-edge Wolf Security suite, which combines an incorruptible BIOS and AI-based malware protection with Sure Click execution of apps and webpages in virtual-machine containers. ,Regardless, it still hurts to realize that the superb ,—a consumer convertible that lacks mobile broadband but has the same tempting 3:2 touch screen—costs a full $1,149 less and is still over a grand cheaper even if you spring for the brilliant 3,000-by-2,000-pixel , screen. Upgrading our Folio G3 with the OLED panel and the max 32GB of memory and 1TB SSD would bring its price to $4,756...and give us a nosebleed.,However, it's important to mention the direct-to-business sales channels that laptops like the Dragonfly Folio are sold through, most usually with arranged price negotiations based on the volume of orders per business and other factors.,A lesser gripe is that the magnesium-chassis Folio narrowly misses our cut for an , at 3.09 pounds—it's certainly no burden in a briefcase, but not the featherweight that the conventional Elite Dragonfly G3 is. When closed, the system measures 0.7 by 11.7 by 9.2 inches, a tad thicker and an inch deeper than the 13.3-inch ,. The 14-inch , is 0.61 by 12.4 by 8.8 inches and a few grams lighter than the HP.,These Dell and Lenovo laptops, however, are Yoga-style convertibles whose screens fold all the way back so that their keyboards face down in tablet mode. HP has bisected the screen lid with a hinge that lets you pull the bottom of the screen forward, then fold it down to cover the keyboard. You can also tilt the display with its bottom edge between the keyboard and touchpad in what HP calls ""Media Mode,"" which is for viewing videos or presentations while keeping the touchpad available for navigation.,As for ports, it's an unsurprisingly short list: The Folio G3 has two 40Gbps , ports with , and DisplayPort functionality on its left flank, along with an audio jack and a SIM card slot. A connector on the laptop's right edge recharges the 6-inch pen as it clings magnetically to the side. You won't find an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, or a flash-card slot.,HP's webcam can capture 6MP 16:9 (3,264 by 1,836) or 8MP 4:3 (3,264 by 2,448) images and 30-frame-per-second (fps) videos, so think twice before not bothering to shave for a conference call. Shots from the camera are well-lit and colorful with no noise or static, and it can keep you the star with a blurred background if you like. Top-row function keys toggle the camera and mute the microphones. An Auto Lock & Awake utility works with Windows Hello face recognition to keep the system secure if you leave your desk.,Quad speakers with a discrete amplifier pump out loud, spectacular sound with a surprising amount of bass. HP's audio isn't harsh or tinny even at top volume, and it's easy to make out overlapping tracks. As a bonus, HP Audio Control software includes AI-based microphone noise reduction—as well as music, movie, and voice playback presets—plus an equalizer.,Besides the two buttons on its barrel, HP's included stylus pen has a button near its top for launching apps, like Microsoft Whiteboard or OneNote, or other functions, like screen snipping with single, double, and long presses. All three buttons are customizable: Along with the pen tip and tilt sensitivity, a pen menu launches when you detach the stylus from the side of the Folio. As I play with the pen, it easily keeps up with my swoops and scribbles with perfect palm rejection. ,I would have liked to see the OLED screen, though it would have cost some battery life. The 1,920-by-1,280 IPS panel is attractive, with decent though not dazzling brightness and high contrast. Viewing angles are wide, white backgrounds are clean, and blacks are deep. Plus, despite lacking OLED tech, the screen's colors are rich and well-saturated. One issue worth mentioning is that the touch-glass overlay is extremely reflective, picking up room lights and showing a mirror image of your face.,Otherwise standard, the backlit keyboard has HP's terrible trademark: hard-to-hit, half-height up and down cursor arrow keys stacked between full-size left and right, rather than arrow keys in the proper inverted T. These keys are otherwise all right, although their shallow, slightly wooden feel isn't comfortable for all-day typing. HP's decently sized, buttonless touchpad glides and taps smoothly and requires moderate pressure for a quiet click.,For our benchmark charts, we're comparing the HP Dragonfly Folio G3 to four other convertibles. Three are business systems: the 14-inch Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 (starts at $1,589.40; $2,456.99 as tested) and , ($2,149.99) and the 13.3-inch Dell Latitude 9330 2-in-1 (starts at $1,969; $2,619.63 as tested). The last slot went to the Folio's abovementioned consumer cousin, the HP Spectre x360 13.5 (starts at $1,149.99; $1,749.99 as tested)—we reviewed the high-res OLED model.,Our primary benchmark, UL's PCMark 10 simulates a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheet work, web browsing, and video conferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess the load time and throughput of a laptop's storage.,Three more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally, we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better). ,Our final productivity test is Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.,HP's Dragonfly Folio narrowly edges its rivals in the all-important PCMark 10, easily clearing the 4,000-point hurdle that indicates excellent productivity for everyday apps like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. ,Our deeper CPU benchmarks see this laptop landing in the middle of the pack despite a slightly faster processor rating than its three 12th Generation Intel peers. Likewise, the laptop trails slightly in Photoshop, though it's fine for occasional image touch-ups. While not a stellar showing, it's clear that this device can handle basic office productivity without issue.,We test Windows PCs' graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite: Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs). ,We also run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. Additionally, we run the 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests, rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions, to exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation respectively. The more frames per second, the better.,These laptops' , restrict them to streaming entertainment and casual games rather than fast-paced shoot-em-ups. Unsurprisingly given its primary use cases, the Folio finishes in the middle of a frankly slow field. With that, don't come to this laptop expecting media chops.,We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie ,) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off. ,Additionally, we use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).,Unfortunately, the Dragonfly's runtime is the shortest in the group, though 12 hours of battery life should easily get you through a full day's work—plus your hypothetical flight to the other corporate branch a few states over. Its IPS touch screen is a capable business-class panel, though it naturally falls short of the brilliant hues seen on the Spectre's OLED display, but with adequate color coverage and brightness.,We'd be happier if the Dragonfly Folio G3 had an HDMI monitor port and happier still if it had a price cut, but corporate execs whose IT departments don't mind its cost will be lucky to get one. It's a fantastic grab-and-go convertible with an ingenious tilt-screen design, take-it-anywhere connectivity, and a tall screen aspect ratio whose roomy view of webpages and documents has charmed us with other laptops and Chromebooks. HP's Dragonfly Folio G3 earns an Editors' Choice award as a brilliant business 2-in-1.,A plush cover and an unusual pull-forward convertible design set HP's Dragonfly Folio G3 apart from most lightweight corporate 2-in-1s.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Kensington SlimBlade Pro Review,"A classic trackball, now cable-free,The updated wireless version of Kensington's SlimBlade trackball still looks great and takes little desk space, but it's no more comfortable to use than the original.,The Kensington SlimBlade finally got a tuneup. The company's low-profile trackball design has been around since 2009, making it one of the older , alternatives on the market. Considering how long it's been, you might expect Kensington to go back to the drawing board and reinvent the wheel (or ball), but the new SlimBlade Pro merely adds a few modern features to justify a modest price increase to $119.99. Most notably, the Pro adds 2.4GHz and Bluetooth wireless support, dual optical sensors for increased precision, and more customization options. These are strong improvements, but revisiting the SlimBlade design after many years reveals a few flaws that the update doesn't address. The extra comforts in the SlimBlade Pro keep the venerable trackball from feeling too outdated, but there's more work to be done. The company's own wireless , trackball remains our top trackball pick.,At a glance, you'll have a tough time spotting the difference between the old SlimBlade and the new. Measuring 2.7 by 5.3 by 6 inches (HWD), the device has the same shiny, graphite-colored plastic base and large ruby-red trackball. True to its name, the SlimBlade Pro is thinner and more compact than most desktop trackballs, particularly for one with a large 55mm ball. Aesthetically, that's a blessing: Most trackballs are bigger and bulkier than the average mouse. So is the Kensington, but its sleek design doesn't look like an eyesore on your desk or take up a ton of desk space.,Of course, that attention to aesthetics takes its toll on ergonomics. The flat, tapered bottom edge of the base provides very little support for your wrist and arm. When using the trackball, your wrist naturally sits flat on your desk, tilted slightly upward. In theory, you could choke up on the trackball to put your wrist on the base, but that would make it harder to move the ball precisely. Realistically, you should still use a wrist rest with the SlimBlade Pro, and it would be nice if Kensington would provide a basic one in the box. After all, what's the point of using a trackball to minimize your lateral wrist movement if you wind up flexing your wrist all day?,The top of the base is divided into four clickable quadrants: left click, right click, center click, and back, by default. You can also set four ""combo clicks""—both left panels, both right panels, both top panels, and both bottom panels—using the KensingtonWorks configuration software. That gives you eight inputs to which you can assign media controls, keyboard shortcuts, and other functions. In lieu of a scroll wheel, you can simply twist the trackball to scroll up and down in documents and webpages. It lacks the satisfying tactile click you get with a scroll wheel, but it feels very natural and reduces the need to move your hand from the trackball.,The physical design of the click panels, however, is unchanged from the old SlimBlade and leaves a lot to be desired. The bottom panels are very large and don't click consistently, requiring more or less pressure depending on where on the panel you click. If you press near the bottom, where you need the most force, you can feel the plastic bend a bit under your finger. If you click in the ideal spot, near the edge of the ball, clicks feel snappy, but finding those spots takes a little time. More important, there's no point in having jumbo click panels if you only want to press certain parts of them.,That said, moving around with the trackball feels fluid and responsive. Like the original SlimBlade, the Pro has two PixArt PAW3220 optical sensors in the base to track the ball's movements. They deliver very tight, responsive tracking. It's not enough to overcome the trackball's natural limitations—I wouldn't recommend ,trackball for precise tasks like gaming or image editing—but I was impressed by how quickly I adjusted from using a mouse to feeling comfortable with the trackball for everyday productivity and web browsing.,The biggest change to the SlimBlade Pro is wireless connectivity. You now have three connection choices: a USB wired link, a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection via a USB dongle, or a Bluetooth wireless connection. This lets you connect up to three devices to the trackball and swap among them at will. On the left side of the base, you'll find a switch that lets you choose a connection or turn the trackball off. On the right is a Bluetooth pairing button that also lets you quickly swap among four preset cursor-speed settings.,According to Kensington, the SlimBlade Pro's battery will last for as much as four months on a charge, so you'll rarely need to plug it in if you don't want to. Like the company's other wireless products, the USB dongle link features 128-bit AES encryption, providing additional protection for workers concerned about possible cybersecurity flaws.,As I said, Kensington provides configuration and button remapping for the SlimBlade Pro via its configuration software, KensingtonWorks. It's a straightforward app that provides access to a basic set of functions including button mapping, cursor-speed adjustment, and scroll speed when you twist the trackball. You can save different button maps for different programs such as Chrome or Zoom, so you have different shortcuts for each app. You can also specify an alternate speed, accessed with a keyboard shortcut, for either extra-fast scrolling or high-precision mousing.,All the functions in KensingtonWorks are simple to set and easy to control, but some obvious configuration options are missing. You can't change the cursor-speed presets that you access using the button on the side of the base. (Even if you could, Kensington does not provide numerical DPI values for cursor-speed settings.) Nor can you save separate trackball profiles for different users (though you could, theoretically, do so by backing up specific settings to cloud storage in case you switch devices). Though KensingtonWorks' simplicity makes things easier for office workers who don't care about precise customization, the baseline standards for mouse software are simply higher than this in 2023.,Even with the jump to wireless, the Kensington SlimBlade Pro feels dated—or, perhaps more accurately, it's a design that's always had flaws despite its longevity. Some aspects of the trackball work very well: It is precise, looks great on your desk, and has a small footprint. But the lack of a wrist rest undercuts its ergonomic value, and its inconsistent click panels make using it feel wonky at times. I'd strongly endorse , wireless trackball, which prioritizes ergonomics and costs slightly less, over either SlimBlade model.,That said, the SlimBlade Pro succeeds in its way. Adding wireless support and other upgrades for only $10 more than the original makes the SlimBlade Pro more appealing if avoiding a bulky-looking trackball is your top priority. Hopefully, however, Kensington won't wait another decade to take a bigger swing with a new compact trackball design.,The updated wireless version of Kensington's SlimBlade trackball still looks great and takes little desk space, but it's no more comfortable to use than the original.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

"Apple MacBook Pro 16-Inch (2023, M2 Max) Review","M2-amped MacBook rips through media tasks like a buzzsaw,If you’re after laptop buying advice, I’m your man. I’ve been reviewing PCs and technology products for more than a decade. I cut my teeth in PC Labs, spending several years with PCMag.com before writing for other outlets, among them LaptopMag.com and Tom’s Guide. While computers are my main focus, I’ve also written at length about topics ranging from fitness gear and appliances to TV and home theater equipment. If I’ve used it, I have opinions about it, whether somebody’s paying me to write them up or not.,Apple's 2023 flagship, the MacBook Pro 16-Inch marries a proven, immaculate design with a fireball M2 Max CPU for fierce power in media creation, gaming, and high-end professional tasks. (Plus, it lasted nearly 27 hours on our battery test.),Apple's biggest and , just got much, , better. The 2023 MacBook Pro 16-Inch (starts at $2,499; $5,299 as tested) holds the largest screen, the highest processing and graphics power, and the most feature-rich experience of any Mac laptop. Apple's design strategy, which keeps some products relatively unchanged for years, may seem slow-moving to some, but it actually speaks to a different concern: refinement. All of the changes made to the , stick around in 2023, with a focus on the major performance boost happening under the hood.,With the introduction of the new , processor lineup, the MacBook Pro offers workstation power in a consumer-friendly design, reminding us why the MacBook has been the choice of creative pros for many years over. Combining this potent power with one of the most polished designs in the industry, the result is pure Apple, and wholly satisfying. In fact, it's the most impressive Apple laptop we've tested to date, earning a rare five stars in addition to our Editors' Choice award. Let's dig into why. (Spoiler alert: The M2 Max is a ,.) ,Apple's shift to its more advanced M2 , line, its newest chips designed in-house, is the biggest change coming to the 16-inch MacBook Pro. You have a choice of either the midrange M2 Pro processor or the more powerful M2 Max seen in our review unit.,At $2,499, the base model for the MacBook Pro 16-inch features a 12-core M2 Pro processor with a 19-core GPU, 16GB of unified memory, and 512GB of SSD storage. This Apple laptop includes all of the standard features, such as the 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, a trio of , ports, an HDMI port, an SDXC card slot, a MagSafe 3 charging port, and every other feature we'll discuss below.,Naturally, the step-up models rise in price, while boosting the feature set. The middle configuration still uses the 12-core M2 Pro processor but bumps things up to a full terabyte of , storage; that model sells for $2,699.,Apple's top-of-the-line loadout, on which our review unit is based, steps up to the more powerful M2 Max, which is still a 12-core CPU built on the same 5-nanometer process as the other M2 chips, but packs in a 38-core GPU, doubling the raw graphics power of the M2 Pro. On top of that, it doubles the memory to 32GB and starts at the larger 1TB of SSD storage. This top configuration starts at $3,499, and the price spikes considerably from there based on your configuration options. You can step up to 64GB of memory for $400, or 96GB of memory for $800 (as we see in our review unit). Storage starts at 1TB, but you can go to 2TB for $400, 4TB for $1,000, or 8TB for $2,200.,Our own review unit is the M2 Max model, with the 12-core CPU and 38-core GPU, but with maxed-out memory at 96GB and plenty of storage with a 4TB SSD—totaling up to $5,299. This is up there with the most expensive laptops we've tested in recent years, but for one of the , on the market, it may just be worth the price if your work demands it.,Outwardly, nothing seems to have changed on the MacBook Pro 16-inch from the ,.  In usual Apple fashion, the philosophy of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" informs much of the decision-making process.,Apple's 2021 redesign introduced a sleeker, cleaner MacBook design that's even more in line with Apple's penchant for iconic, minimalist products. This lack of change is actually welcome because the updated MacBook Pro keeps everything I like, including thinner bezels around the higher-resolution (3,456-by-2,234-pixel) Liquid Retina XDR display. A little flatter than prior designs, the machined, recycled-aluminum chassis of the MacBook Pro still makes for a sturdy and beautiful unibody shell that helps reduce your environmental impact.,Also a carryover from 2021 is Apple's updated Magic Keyboard, with square-tiled keys that enable decent enough typing. If you've used a Mac in the last few years (or even the desktop version of the Magic Keyboard), then you already know what it's like. Apple's shallow keys combine the ultra-low profile of a membrane dome switch with scissor-switch mechanical stabilizers, a welcome return to form after the , of a few years back.,The keyboard's depth means the individual keys don't provide much travel, but the effortless downstroke is matched with a solid click at the bottom, providing tactile feedback that makes each keystroke feel distinct, and reduces the half-presses and accidental presses that make for frustrating typos. Plus, there's just a cool look to these keys. Instead of the bare aluminum surround that's seen on the , or the ,, the larger Pro models use a black-on-black color scheme that looks more subdued and helps the automatic backlight look brighter as it lights up the keys.,The real benefit to this design is that Apple switched back to a proper keyboard with full-size function keys, moving away from the Touch Bar micro-display it is still using on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. This keyboard also includes a power button with a built-in Touch ID sensor, letting you sign on to your machine without the hassle of passwords or PIN numbers. (It also secures transactions for anything you buy online through Apple Pay.),Joining that keyboard is a massive trackpad, giving you ample room for all of your swiping, clicking, and gestures. And because it uses Apple's Force Touch technology, the surface responds with haptic feedback for more precise control and multi-level, pressure-based contextual menus. A deeper click opens up new functions, while lighter taps and touches work just fine for all of your standard navigation. The pad is precise, and the feedback is crisp, making it one of the best touchpads we've seen on any machine.,Sticking with the 2021 redesign means that the new 16-inch MacBook Pro also keeps some of the things I don't like, such as the intrusive webcam notch that houses the MacBook Pro's 1080p FaceTime webcam. More on that later.,Weighing 4.8 pounds, the 16-inch laptop is not lightweight, and this is despite its fairly slim dimensions of 0.66 by 14.01 by 9.77 inches. Our M2 Max-equipped model also comes with the 140-watt USB Type-C power adapter and USB-C-to-MagSafe cable, which brings the total weight to nearly 5 pounds. However, we'll forgive it, given the generous 16-inch screen and the amount of raw power packed into this laptop. Most Windows machines in this performance class weigh 7 pounds or more, so we'll save our complaints for real issues—of which there are few.,Taking a closer look at Apple's 16.2-inch screen, branded as Liquid Retina XDR, it's simply one of the best around. Made up of a 120Hz oxide-TFT panel backlit with thousands of mini LEDs, the display is truly impressive. The , screen also uses ProMotion, Apple's answer to adaptive sync technologies, like AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync. Mini LED breaks up the lighting zones into hundreds of addressable areas behind the screen, giving you fantastic contrast control that rivals OLED in most respects. Colors are incredibly bright and vibrant, without any of the washout you get on a display that simply has an over-amped backlight.,This technology allows for extraordinarily high contrast and the deep, rich blacks that are normally associated with an OLED panel. When viewing most content on the mini LED-backed display, the quality is astounding. But, every so often, you'll find something that highlights the trouble of any backlit screen, where one or two dimming zones will overlap between a brightly lit portion of the picture and a darkened portion of the picture, and it doesn't always do a satisfactory job of differentiating between the two, leaving a brightly lit spot when it shouldn't be. Mini LED reduces this problem considerably compared to less granular dimming alternatives, but the higher brightness occasionally makes the problem stick out like a sore thumb.,However, there are two real problems with the display that we don't expect Apple to change anytime soon. The first has already been mentioned, the ,, which is a cutout along the top bezel that disrupts menu bars and anything else along the top of the screen in order to put the FaceTime camera behind the display glass without making the top bezel chunkier.,A carryover from the iPhone, the notch seems to be part of Apple's current design ID—but I have to say, I've never been able to get used to it. At best, I forget that it's there. But that's just as true for bezel-mounted webcams, and they don't disrupt onscreen content. The notch itself is probably handled as elegantly as it can be, but the fact that it's there still bugs me.,One other small problem is what , there: touch controls. Touch screens have become a mainstay of Windows laptops, spurred in part by the massive success of touch interaction on the iPhone and iPad. Despite this, Apple still hasn't brought touch input to the Mac, aside from the largely unloved Touch Bar on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you're looking for a laptop with an excellent touch screen, you won't find it at the Apple Store.,Apple surprised us in 2021 when it changed up the port selection on the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, reintroducing HDMI output and an SD card slot. After several Mac models that defaulted entirely to Thunderbolt/, for all connectivity, it is a welcome improvement and an unexpected response to user complaints. Those ports stick around on the new MacBook Pro—good move. ,On the right, you'll find that HDMI port and the SDXC card slot, along with a single Thunderbolt 4/USB-C connection. On the left, there's a MagSafe charging port, along with dual Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, and a headphone/audio headset jack. ,Given that Apple removed the headphone jack from its iPhones a few years back (and even called itself brave for doing so), we're always happy to see the humble headphone jack stick around on the MacBook. The port selection may be staying the same, but wireless connectivity takes a step forward in this model, kicked up to , for best-in-class wireless networking, and ,, for the best accessory and peripheral connection quality yet.,Choosing Apple means choosing macOS in addition to the slick Apple hardware. While this has launched a thousand think pieces and ads pitting Windows and Mac users against each other (and ,), I'm happy to say that there's no real loser in that face-off. Since the advent of ,, Windows and macOS look more alike than ever before, sharing more than a few features. More than that, both are very mature, highly refined operating systems.,One of the benefits of maturity—well, maturity plus market share—is that key software makers regularly make their products for both Windows and macOS these days. All of the big names are here, including Microsoft's Office suite, the entire Adobe Creative Cloud, and many more. On top of that, Apple has its own homegrown macOS apps that have been improving for years, from the Safari browser to ,. Anything you want to do on a computer, you can do on a Mac just as well as any Windows machine, although you still may need to hunt down the right software.,The latest version of Apple's operating system, ,, seems to be everything you need it to be. I'll leave the rest for other qualified reviewers to dig into the specifics (hit the link for our review), but in my time reviewing the machine, I've encountered very few issues, aside from having one or two specific test programs that didn't carry over from Windows.,To get a true measure of where the MacBook Pro 16-inch stands among its peers, we have to look at both Apple and Windows machines. In the Apple world, we're looking at the previous model, the ,, to see what sort of performance gains were made with the move to M2 Max. Also included: the more recent , and , (both with the basic M2 chip), as well as some passing comparisons to the current desktop powerhouse, the ,, which comes in M1 Max and , variants.,Looking at other brands, we turn to some favorites from our collections of the , and workstation laptops, as well as the ,. With so many general users and professionals using the MacBook Pro for a wide variety of tasks, we could have slotted it against any number of other category leaders. But the business use is so prevalent, and the power level so impressive, that we're sticking to those core categories to find our top competitors.,These include the ,, the outstanding , and ,, and the powerful , mobile workstation. These systems represent a cross-section of sleek designs and potent hardware that give the MacBook Pro 16 a run for its money. But as you can see in our breakdown of comparison models, nothing quite offers the single complete package that Apple's MacBook Pro does, especially in the beast-mode configuration we received for review.,The caveat, whenever we compare Macs to Windows machines, is that the Mac vs. PC divide is still very real, with nuances and quirks that make cross-platform tests tricky. Not everything that we test Windows machines with will work on Macs, and vice versa. However, even with the reduced selection, there's still plenty to compare, from productivity software to graphics and even workstation tests.,In this case, we start with our HandBrake 1.4 video transcoding test, timing how long it takes to convert a standard 4K clip into a smaller 1080p version. It's a heavy lift for some machines, but the best media-editing laptops should make short work of it.,Then we move on to Cinebench R23, which tests multi-core and multi-threaded processing with a complex scene rendered in Maxon’s Cinema 4D engine. For more basic productivity measurements, we look at Primate Labs’ Geekbench Pro, which simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning.,Finally, we use Adobe Photoshop running in Rosetta 2, which comes with an asterisk—Adobe has a native version of Photoshop as part of its Creative Cloud apps, but our test extension, made by ,, is only available using Rosetta 2. So, in this instance, it's less of a photo-editing-speed test, and more a measure of the performance offered on the machine for demanding apps that require emulation. Even with that caveat, the Mac performance holds up incredibly well against top Windows machines.,In HandBrake, the performance is dramatic, with the M2 Max cutting the transcode time in half versus systems like the Dell XPS 17 (9720), and shaving off several minutes compared to both competing Windows laptops and less-expensive Apple options. In fact, the only machine that can complete the test faster is the ,, a small desktop that's home to Apple's current top-performing chip, the M1 Ultra.,As for Cinebench, the M2 Max-powered MacBook Pro 16 posts nearly 15,000 points, beating out the 12,000-point average and rocketing past the less-powerful MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, which both use the entry-level M2 chip. That same pattern is repeated in Geekbench, where the M2 Max pushes the MacBook Pro 16-Inch to impressive second-best in a list of extremely powerful systems. In Photoshop, the MacBook Pro 16-Inch actually edges ahead of the Mac Studio! (This is likely due to the updated M2 platform improving emulation performance.) If you need raw power, but can't bear to be tethered to a stationary desktop like the Mac Studio, this is the machine to get.,Armed with 38 GPU cores in our test model, we also expect the 16-inch MacBook Pro to put on a solid showing in graphics and gaming tests. For an Apple-specific graphics test, we use 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme, running in Unlimited mode. Unlike our usual 3DMark tests, Wild Life runs natively on Apple Silicon, letting us measure graphics performance between different Mac systems. The higher the score, the better the overall graphics performance.,For cross-platform testing, we use a version of our standard GFXBench test, here running on Apple’s Metal graphics API. It stress-tests both low-level routines, like texturing, and high-level, game-like image rendering. We run two subtests, Aztec Ruins (1440p), which relies on the OpenGL application programming interface (API), and Car Chase (1080p), which uses hardware tessellation. We record the results in frames per second (fps); higher numbers are better.,Finally, in Rise of the Tomb Raider, our only ""true"" gaming test, we get a sense of the system's actual AAA-gaming capabilities. Yes, it's an older game, but it's one of the few in the Steam library that will both run on a Mac and offers a built-in benchmark utility. We record the average fps at different detail settings. Higher numbers are better.,It's within the Wild Life Extreme results that we get the best glimpse of where the M2 Max sits in the Apple Silicon family, demonstrating superb graphical performance. Where the M2-based MacBook Pro 13-inch scores 6,800 points, the M2 Max-powered Pro scores more than 25,000. That handily beats anything we saw running on the previous M1 Max processor, and it comes in second to only the M1 Ultra. Yes, this is the top-end, most-cores version of the M2 Max, but it's a huge jump forward in graphics power in one processor generation, and it proves that Apple's chip design team is not messing around.,Our GFXBench results display similar Apple M2 Max dominance, as the MacBook Pro 16-Inch tears through both the basic 1080p Car Chase and the more demanding 1440p Aztec Ruins test scenarios.,Naturally, in Rise of the Tomb Raider, the M2 Max dominates everything, delivering the best gaming performance we've seen in a Mac to date. We'll dig into the gaming side of things more in future testing, but for the purpose of this review, it's clear that gaming on a Mac is suddenly a very real possibility, in addition to the media creation we already knew it could handle. Well in excess of 150 frames per second (fps) at 1,920 by 1,200 and high detail, and with the low-detail setting topping 200fps? This is proper gaming-laptop territory.,Going a step beyond the usual gaming or media processing tests, we also fired up the seminal Blender utility to see how well the MacBook Pro 16-Inch could handle true 3D rendering. Using the open-source 3D suite, we record the time it takes for its built-in Cycles path tracer to render two photorealistic scenes of BMW cars, one using the system's CPU, and the other relying on the GPU.,It's a test we reserve for the most powerful machines, and here the MacBook Pro 16-Inch floors us. The results speak for themselves, but it's worth pointing out that this MacBook Pro delivers some of the best performance on this test we've ever seen from a laptop.,All the power in the world doesn't mean much in a laptop if you can't take it anywhere, but mobility is usually sacrificed to deliver the kind of power we've seen above. Despite this, Apple claims some impressive energy efficiency for the newest batch of M2 chips, promising as much as 22 hours of battery life. Obviously, we were going to test these claims, but I am most eager to see how the system would balance the power demands of the muscular CPU and GPU with the efficiency needed for long-lasting mobility.,We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie ,) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.,We also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).,Given Apple's claims of battery life, we fully expected to see the MacBook Pro 16-inch last all day long and then some. (After all, the largest laptop in the Mac lineup is also the one with the biggest battery.) Plus, Apple's increasingly efficient hardware has been lengthening battery life since the M1 chip's arrival. But, we weren't prepared for this: In our video rundown test, the MacBook Pro 16-Inch lasted an astonishing 26 hours and 51 minutes—one of the longest results we've ever seen on any laptop short of models like the first ,. ,In fact, the MacBook Pro 16-Inch outlasts most , by hours. Granted, more power-intensive uses, such as media editing or graphics rendering, will reduce that number. But for watching videos or web browsing? That's enough battery to get you through a three-day weekend without a charger.,The Liquid Retina XDR display is equally impressive, leveraging its mini LED backlight for excellent contrast and brightness. But what was most impressive was the color quality. In our testing, the screen, ahem, ""notched"" perfect 100% scores in coverage of the both sRGB and DCI-P3 color spaces, and there's no denying that it's one of the best-looking displays we've seen, even when compared to premium OLED panels used on top-end Windows machines.,We've been testing and reviewing laptops for a long time, and it's rare that one leaves us this impressed. This latest rev of the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M2 Max simply has it all, from a refined design and rich feature set to astonishing battery life and truly dominant levels of performance. ,Sure, we can nitpick about the screen notch or the lack of touch capability, but the fact of the matter is that this is as close to perfect as any laptop we have reviewed. The machine looks and feels fantastic, and it will rip through the most demanding computing tasks like a buzzsaw. The only drawback is the price in its upper-echelon configurations. However, if you're a professional that needs the power to match the demands of your job and your talents, it's hard to argue that this isn't worth the outlay. For absolutely topping the charts among laptops in an already winning design, this MacBook Pro earns our Editors' Choice award and a rare perfect score.,Apple's 2023 flagship, the MacBook Pro 16-Inch marries a proven, immaculate design with a fireball M2 Max CPU for fierce power in media creation, gaming, and high-end professional tasks.

MGM+ Review,"Stream magnificent mainstream movies,In 2013, I started my Ziff Davis career as an intern on PCMag's Software team. Now, I’m an Analyst on the Apps and Gaming team, and I really just want to use my fancy Northwestern University journalism degree to write about video games. I host ,, ,'s video game show. I was previously the Senior Editor for ,. I’ve also written for ,, ,and ,I’m currently working on a book about the history of video games, and I’m the reason everything you think you know about , is a lie.,MGM+ is a streaming video service with a film library that honors the studio’s cinema legacy, but it lacks a few common features found in rival platforms.,Formerly known as Epix, MGM+ is a revamped, Amazon-owned , with a classic cinematic brand. When you hear the big, golden lion roar, you know a good movie is about to start. The service’s rich film library does justice to this pedigree, with old classics alongside modern hits and original shows. We just wish using the service felt a bit less antiquated.,Before it arrived on streaming, MGM+ started as a film-centric premium cable channel—think channels like HBO, ,, and ,. Its library consists of thousands of movies, including classics from MGM’s catalog, as well as recent hits from across all genres that have only just left the theaters. It's an enticing service for ,.,MGM+'s contemporary movies include , and ,. Besides arthouse services like ,, many streaming subscriptions struggle to provide films that weren’t made in the past few years. However, the MGM+ library also includes classic films like ,.,Alongside the on-demand library, MGM+ features four “live” channels that broadcast films 24/7. The channels have different themes, such as MGM+ Hits and MGM+ Drive-In, which is a great way to just sit back and appreciate the breadth of content. The library has some occasional gaps, though. For example, you can stream many James Bond and Rocky movies, but not every single film in either of those beloved franchises. ,MGM+ focuses on movies rather than television (or ,). Still, it has exciting original shows like , starring Forest Whitaker, and a documentary series about The Rolling Stones. MGM+ occasionally lets non-subscribers watch episodes for free. MGM is now owned by Amazon, but you won’t find any original , shows here or vice versa. ,After a seven-day free trial, MGM+ costs $5.99 per month or $50 per year. Compared with other major premium channels, that’s a pretty good deal. For example, Starz costs $8.99 per month, while Showtime costs $10.99. MGM+’s single ad-free tier is also less expensive than the ad-supported tiers for ,, ,, and Netflix.,You can subscribe to MGM+ as a standalone service or purchase it as an add-on channel for a larger streaming service, such as Amazon Prime Video or ,. MGM+ is available via browser, mobile (,, ,), and , (Fire TV, Roku). It’s not available on video game consoles.  ,On desktop, MGM+ has an almost shockingly lackluster interface. The Browse screen features rows of different categories—such as New This Month, Featured Movies, or MGM Comedies—but that’s it. You can’t pull up a genre list. There’s not even a search field to type in movie names or actors. If there’s something you specifically want to see, navigating to it is so much slower and more roundabout compared to basically any other streaming service. ,Once you select a listing, the page features a short synopsis, rating, cast and crew, and a trailer if available. There are no social features like sharing a link or leaving reviews and comments. However, the page's bottom features related and recommended movies to watch once you’re finished. The player doesn’t have any extra functionality, and you can’t adjust video quality. Still, I could tell resolutions were HD, and playback was smooth over my home Wi-Fi connection (60Mbps download). ,I don’t recommend using MGM+ on your desktop. If you want the service’s great content, you may be better off subscribing to it as an add-on channel for streaming service with a far more robust interface. However, the MGM+ mobile app fixes most of these problems. On the app, you can search for specific films and actors. Movies and original shows have their own separate tabs. Unlike on the web, the MGM+ mobile apps lets you save movies to a personal watchlist. You can also download movies for offline mobile viewing, in SD or HD, and stream on up to six devices at once. Even the interface looks better on mobile, thanks to a denser and more exciting layout. Thankfully, all of these features are also available in the , app, so you don’t have to choose between watching on a big screen or gaining a proper interface. ,Accessibility is another area where MGM+ needs improvement. You can turn English subtitles on and off, but that’s it. You can’t customize subtitles or activate more advanced features, such as audio descriptions or adjusting playback speed. This is the case on both the web and on mobile.,As for parental controls, parents can restrict their account from showing movies above a certain MPAA age rating. But you can’t, say, create a child account and an adult account under the same subscription.  ,A , is an essential tool to keep yourself safe and secure online. It spoofs your geographic location to another part of the world, so , because of regional licensing deals.,Unfortunately, MGM+ is one of those services. MGM+ is only available in the United States, so I wasn’t surprised that the service didn’t work when the VPN connected to overseas , servers. However, I still couldn’t stream content even after switching to US-based servers. MGM+ doesn’t work with VPNs at all.  ,MGM’s logo is “art for art’s sake,” and that’s apparent in MGM+. Few streaming services offer such an affordable and straightforward way to watch so many great movies. Its strength is its library, not the app itself, so it may be better as a supplement to another streaming service rather than a pillar. Still, MGM+ is worthwhile viewing.  , is our Editors’ Choice winner for mainstream video streaming, thanks to its awesome originals and nifty features. , and YouTube TV are our Editors’ Choice picks for live TV streaming services. , is our free Editors’ Choice winner that becomes even better with premium upgrade options. ,For more on streaming, check out five reasons why you may want to ditch your video subscription and ,; read how streaming has ushered in a new ,; and learn why companies must ,.

Canon imageFormula R40 Document Scanner Receipt Edition Review,"Stacks of slips and bills have met their match,I focus on printer and scanner technology and reviews. I have been writing about computer technology since well before the advent of the internet. I have authored or co-authored 20 books—including titles in the popular ,and, series—on digital design and desktop publishing software applications. My published expertise in those areas includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, and QuarkXPress, as well as prepress imaging technology. (Over my long career, though, I have covered many aspects of IT.),Canon's imageFormula R40 Receipt Edition is a reasonably priced desktop receipt and document scanner aimed at home workers and small-to-midsize offices and workgroups.,The prices for most high-tech hardware goes down, not up, over the years, but some niche gear can buck that trend and still stay competitive. Take Canon's imageFormula R40 Office Document Scanner Receipt Edition: At $399, it's $130 more than the base-model , we reviewed in March 2020. The main justification for upping this new ,'s cost is special software for gleaning, sorting, and saving financial data from receipts, statements, invoices, and the like. A direct competitor to the outstanding ,, the R40 Receipt Edition scans everyday office documents, as well as financial data, reliably and accurately. It's also a solid value, with a list price $100 below the Epson's. Unfortunately for Canon, at this writing the RR-600W had been discounted to match its rival's cost, and retains a slight edge as our Editors' Choice among receipt and document scanners.,In most cases, upgrading a sheetfed document scanner to a document and receipt scanner is simply a matter of bundling a processing module or plug-in that digitizes, sorts, and archives financial data. We'll look at that in more detail momentarily, but first let's talk about the hardware.,The new imageFormula R40, like its predecessor, measures 9.6 by 11.4 by 9.9 inches with its paper trays closed, and it weighs 6.2 pounds. Like the Epson and most other scanners in this class, the Canon's desktop footprint doubles or triples when its input and output trays are open for business.,A few other competitors include the , with BR-Receipts, the ,, and the ,. Given an inch or two and a pound or so in any direction, these and several other low-to-medium-volume document scanners are similar in size and weight.,Some, however, are better suited to being worked from their control panels, which typically become available after you open their output trays. The R40's panel consists of a selection button for scrolling through profile numbers, Start and Stop buttons, and a manual-feed toggle that helps you adjust for thicker documents such as ID cards, plus a monochrome LCD for selecting numbered workflow profiles. You create and edit profiles using the bundled software, discussed shortly.,Compared to the two Canons' modest control panels, the color touch screens of the ScanSnap iX1600 and RapidReceipt RR-600W let you do much more in the way of configuring and executing scans, as well as creating and editing workflow profiles or shortcuts. Some entries such as the iX1600 and the , boast control panels not only capable of setting up and running scans but editing, saving, and archiving documents.,The imageFormula R40 Receipt Edition can scan documents as small as 2 by 2.1 inches and as large as 8.5 by 118 inches (9.8 feet). Its automatic document feeder (ADF) holds up to 60 pages and its daily duty cycle is rated at 4,000 scans, matching the ratings of the Brother ADS-3300W, the Epson RR-600W, and the ScanSnap iX1600. The Fujitsu's ADF capacity is a bit smaller (50 pages), while the RR-600W's is bigger (100 pages). With a 20-sheet ADF and daily volume rating of 500 scans, the Epson ES-300WR is a good portable-scanning solution.,The R40 comes with only one interface, a USB 2.0 port for cable connection to a single computer. As long as that computer is connected to the internet, however, the scanner can easily access cloud and social media sites, as well as local drives on your PC and drives on other systems on your office network.,Restricting connectivity to USB precludes scanning to handheld devices like smartphones and tablets. Unless you scan from the control panel or deploy the scanner into an existing document management system with its own software, you'll most likely use one or more of the utilities in Canon's downloadable bundle.,These include Windows and macOS TWAIN drivers for use with the many third-party apps (including Microsoft Office 365 and most Adobe programs) that support direct scanner input, as well as Canon's CaptureOnTouch scanning utility and document management software. Windows-only apps include Readiris PDF and Cardiris business-card scanning and contact-archiving software.,CaptureOnTouch is a fairly comprehensive scanner interface with essential document archiving features. You get a wide range of options that allow you to swiftly and effectively digitize hardcopy documents and save them in searchable formats according to parameters laid down in the selected workflow profile. It's also the utility you'll use when creating and editing workflow shortcuts for selection from the R40's control panel.,Canon rates the imageFormula R40 Receipt Edition at 40 one-sided pages per minute (ppm) and 80 two-sided images per minute (ipm), where each page side counts as an image. These speeds are about average for the class, with the Epson RR-600W and Fujitsu iX1600 slightly slower at 35ppm/70ipm and the portable Epson ES-300WR slower still at 25ppm/50ipm.,I ran my tests over a USB connection to our Intel Core i5 testbed running Windows 10 Pro and Canon CaptureOnTouch. First, I clocked the R40 as it scanned our 25-page one-sided and two-sided (50 sides) text documents, using the CaptureOnTouch software to save the scans to image PDF format. The Receipt Edition averaged 42.4ppm and 82.1ipm, a couple of pages per minute faster than its 2020 predecessor. Other document scanners rated at 40ppm/80ipm came in fractionally faster, but the R40 handily beat the two slower-rated Epsons.,Next, I timed the R40 Receipt Edition as it scanned, converted, and saved our 25-page two-sided (50 sides) text document to the more useful searchable PDF format. The Canon finished the job—from paper pages to editable text—in 39 seconds, which is one of the quickest times we've seen in this class. Only the Brother was a tick faster (37 seconds), with the others a second or two slower (except for the portable Epson ES-300WR at 55 seconds).,As for optical character recognition accuracy, it's rapidly becoming one of our more boring benchmarks, in a good way: Most modern document scanners do it almost equally well. The imageFormula read both our Arial and Times New Roman pages error-free down to 6 points. While the 2020 model and the Fujitsu got down to 4 points with Arial and the Epson RR-600W to 5 points, few businesses ever encounter type smaller than 10 points in real-world documents. In other words, most users don't need anything better than this.,I also scanned a few stacks of receipts and other financial documents. After some initial setup, the software did a respectable job of gleaning numbers, field names, and other pertinent data from the slips, and sorting and saving the data as required, without a lot of hand-holding and with very few errors. I had no issues with the Receipt Edition plug-in to the CaptureOnTouch interface.,When it comes to combination document and receipt scanners like this one, it's tough to beat the 4.5-star-rated Epson RapidReceipt RR-600W. Nevertheless, the Canon imageFormula R40 Receipt Edition is fast, accurate, and competitively priced, joining the Brother ADS-3300W as an excellent alternative for any entry-level-to-midrange document and financial scanning environment.

Dell Pro Webcam Review,"A capable all-in-one webcam,I’ve been PCMag’s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).,The Dell Pro Webcam offers a well-rounded feature set and some of the best audio and video performance you can expect for under $100.,The , ($199.99) we reviewed back in 2021 is a sleek aluminum device that offers a crisp 4K picture, but it’s pricey and doesn’t have a microphone for audio. The somewhat confusingly named Dell Pro Webcam is like a less ""pro"" version of the UltraSharp model, and yet it presents a much better value at $99.99. The Dell Pro captures a bright, sharp 2K picture and adds audio support for half the price of the UltraSharp model. While it isn't the absolute best at any one thing, its combined video and audio performance at an appealing price earn it our Editors’ Choice award for affordable ,.,Dell takes the pipe-like design of the UltraSharp Webcam and puts a more compact twist on it for the Pro Webcam. It’s a 3.5-by-1.7-inch (HW) black plastic cylinder with a magnetic lens cap that clings to the back of the camera for storing when you’re using it. It doesn't have the sleek aluminum body of the UltraSharp Webcam, but it’s light and simple. ,The clip is integrated into the cylinder as a flip-down foot. This adjustable foot is coated in rubber to protect your monitor or PC, and the hinge is strong enough so that the camera can hold its position at a wide range of vertical angles. Like the UltraSharp Webcam, the Pro Webcam cannot pivot left or right. A tripod mount is located on the bottom of the adjustable foot. It plugs into your computer or hub via USB-A, which means it may not work with machines that only include USB-C.,The Pro Webcam makes a few trade-offs with the UltraSharp model to reach its lower price. The webcam can capture video at up to 2K QHD (2,560 by 1,440) resolution at 24 or 30 frames per second, or at 1080p or 720p at up to 60 frames per second, with a field of view of 65 or 78 degrees depending on the setting. It can’t record 4K video and doesn’t have a 90-degree viewing angle like the UltraSharp, but those are reasonable compromises. ,More importantly, the Pro Webcam includes a microphone, which the UltraSharp lacks. You don’t need to spend money on a separate microphone, use a headset, or rely on your computer's microphone when on video calls. Voices sound clear through the camera’s mic, though it can pick up echo from time to time and doesn't quite match the quality of a dedicated , (which we always recommend for the best possible audio).,Like the UltraSharp Webcam, you can control the Pro Webcam with the Dell Peripheral Manager software (available for macOS and Windows 10/11). It’s a simple app that lets you set the camera’s field of view, enable AI-based auto framing (which follows you and digitally zooms on your face), manually frame with digital zoom, toggle autofocus, set focus manually, and set capture priority to exposure or frame rate. You can also set the resolution and frame rate, toggle high dynamic range (HDR) capture and automatic white balance, make manual exposure tweaks, and enable or disable the microphone. It’s a basic app, but it does have a live preview and can record video clips on its own. These settings don't take more than a few moments to adjust and can then be safely forgotten.,The two available fields of view are sufficient for both up-close video calls and slightly wider shots, though neither is quite wide enough to comfortably support a larger group shot. The auto-framing feature is sluggish and not particularly aggressive—it is slow to recognize and pan to faces, and the zoom accomplishes little, so don’t expect it to quickly follow you around the frame.,The up-to-2K resolution of the camera can capture detailed video that shows textures like hair and beard stubble, but it isn’t the crispest picture we've seen. Some noise appears even in shots illuminated by a fill light. The softness isn’t too disruptive, and details are preserved both in the foreground and background (there's no built-in background blurring feature). The picture quality is comparable with the ,, while both the UltraSharp Webcam and the , ($299.99) are a bit sharper. ,The picture becomes noticeably noisier in low light, but in a dark room with only the light from my monitor, it managed to balance the exposure. It was fuzzy, but not dark. Using a Logitech Litra fill light drastically improved the picture, cutting the noise down to about the same level as if I was recording in a bright room. The background was still noisy, but I appeared much sharper.,The Dell Pro Webcam is a step back from the UltraSharp Webcam in both picture and build quality, but for $99.99, it’s a much more reasonable buy. It’s sharp enough for video calls and its built-in microphone lets you communicate clearly without extra equipment. It performs as well as the Razer Kiyo Pro for half the price, and that earns it our Editors’ Choice award for affordable webcams. If you need a wider angle to cover a small conference room rather than just a desk, the , ($129.99) is a better choice for its 115-degree field of view, and if you want to save a bit of money, the , ($79.99) also offers strong performance for a slightly lower price, but neither is quite as well-rounded as the Dell Pro.,The Dell Pro Webcam offers a well-rounded feature set and some of the best audio and video performance you can expect for under $100.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Kobo Clara 2E Review,"The best Paperwhite alternative,I love portable technology—if you can put it in a pocket or a bag, I’m probably into it. I’ve covered phones and tablets of all shapes and sizes, and reviewed everything from game consoles to laptops in my decade-plus career. Prior to joining PCMag, I wrote articles for Android Authority, How-To Geek, MUO, New Atlas, Tom’s Hardware, and plenty of other tech publications.,The waterproof, environment-friendly Kobo Clara 2E isn't quite as fast as the Kindle Paperwhite, but it offers broader file support and easier access to public library ebooks.,Kobo puts the environment front and center with the Clara 2E ($129.99)—ocean-bound and recycled plastics form the outer shell of the ,, and it ships in recycled packaging. Thankfully, it doesn't set features aside to be good for the planet, as it offers a bright and sharp E Ink touch screen, 16GB of storage, and a waterproof build to match the competition. Slightly sluggish performance keeps it from beating our Editor's Choice winner in this price range, Amazon's , ($139.99), but the Clara 2E is one of the best Paperwhite alternatives to consider, especially if you want broader format support than Amazon offers.,One of our favorite aspects of the Kobo Clara 2E is its size—it's compact enough to put in a pocket. The device measures 6.26 by 4.41 by 0.34 inches (HWD) and is reasonably light at 6.03 ounces, so holding it won't tire your hands and arms during marathon reading sessions. While big-screen ebook readers certainly have their place, there's something to be said for the portability of the compact Clara 2E.,The display is a 6-inch, 1,448-by-1,072 E Ink Carta 1200 touch screen, with a pixel density of 300ppi. That's an upgrade from the 6-inch screen of the $109.99 ,, which has a pixel density of 212ppi. Text and images look vibrant on the black-and-white screen. There are various ways to customize the Clara 2E, with 13 fonts and more than 50 font styles. You can also change the brightness and color temperature with the ComfortLight Pro tool to dial in the right amount and warmth of light for your eyes. Like many modern devices, there's a dark mode that inverts the text and background, which some people find easier to look at. We prefer the light mode, as it looks more like traditional book pages, but it's nice to have the option.,The Clara 2E has an ,. That means you can submerge it for up to 60 minutes in two meters of water, so it's safe for use in the bathtub. There is no official protection from dust and other small particles, but since it's waterproof it can be rinsed off easily.,As mentioned, Kobo is targeting readers who care about the , with the Clara 2E, as significant portions of its body have been made with ocean-bound and recycled plastics. That’s great, and importantly, you can’t tell it’s made with recycled materials. If you pick up the Clara 2E and compare it with a Kindle, you’d have no reason to think its plastics are different. Moreover, using recycled materials doesn't impact the price or experience; the Clara 2E is in the same price and feature bracket as its closest competitors.,There's a single button on the rear of the device that's used for powering it on and off. It's placed in an ideal spot, near the top, that helps you avoid the accidental presses that were common on previous models. A USB-C port sits on the bottom for charging. The cable comes in the box, but you will need to use your own power adapter, as it doesn't come with one (keeping in step with the environmentally conscious theme). ,Kobo offers an optional sleep cover ($29.99) that also serves as a stand for the device. We received one with our test unit and it's very well made. It adds minimal bulk, puts the device to sleep when closed, and keeps it comfortably propped up when needed. ,The Kobo Clara 2E has a 1GHz processor with 512MB of RAM, just like the Kindle Paperwhite. However, the Paperwhite feels noticeably faster than the Kobo. Browsing library books and downloading content on the Clara 2E is a bit slow, scrolling through your library takes a beat longer than you'd expect, and even just turning the page is a little sluggish. ,On the plus side, the Clara 2E features 16GB of space for your books, while the Paperwhite comes with just 8GB (unless you pay significantly more for the 32GB Signature Edition). While ebook files are generally small (Kobo says the Clara 2E can hold 12,000 ebooks), books with lots of graphics or illustrations and audiobooks can take up much more space and chew through storage quickly. Just keep in mind that you can only use Kobo's audiobooks; there's no way to load other audiobook formats onto the device.,The Clara 2E includes Bluetooth, which is in the only way to listen to said audiobooks; it doesn't have a 3.5mm port, so wired headphones aren't an option. ,Like most ebook readers, the Clara 2E excels at battery life. We were able to read on and off for weeks at a time before we had to charge it. It's an ideal companion for flights, vacations, and other travel.,Kobo ebook readers generally tend to be better than Kindles if you like to borrow books from the library and/or want to read content in a wide variety of file types. When it comes to public library access on the Clara 2E, you can simply log in with your local library account through OverDrive and select books from there. (We tested it by borrowing Stephen King’s ""The Stand"" and it worked flawlessly.) Now, Kindles also support public libraries via OverDrive, but it's ,.,The Clara 2E supports 15 file formats natively, in addition to Kobo’s audiobooks. It supports EPUB, EPUB3, FlePub, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TXT, HTML, and RTF. Further, you can download and read CBZ and CBR comic books.,There's an on-device store if you want to purchase books directly from Kobo, and prices seem comparable with Amazon and Apple.,We also tested sideloading books a few different ways and the process is easy. You can use the included USB cable to load them directly from a computer, and the included web browser lets you download books from the internet directly over Wi-Fi. We tried EPUB, MOBI, and PDF books, and they all worked well. ,The Kobo Clara 2E ticks a lot of boxes. It's affordable, compact, and has a fantastic screen. It supports a wide range of ebook formats, and comes in a waterproof, environmentally friendly build. It's superior to recent devices from Barnes & Noble, such as the , ($119.99), which has an uneven display and isn't waterproof. For most readers, however, we think the Kindle Paperwhite offers the best reading experience for the price, thanks in part to a faster, smoother interface than you get with the Clara 2E. But if you read most of your books from the library or want to read lots of different file formats, the Clara 2E is a worthwhile alternative.,The waterproof, environment-friendly Kobo Clara 2E isn't quite as fast as the Kindle Paperwhite, but it offers broader file support and easier access to public library ebooks.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Michael Justin Allen Sexton,"For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming. I began working on computers owned by immediate family members and relatives when I was around 10 years old. I've always sought to learn as much as possible about anything PC, leading to a well-rounded grasp on all things tech today. In my role at PCMag, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to share what I know.,I wrote for the well-known tech site Tom's Hardware for three years before I joined PCMag in 2018. In that time, I've reviewed desktops, PC cases, and motherboards as a freelancer, while also producing deals content for the site and its sibling ExtremeTech. Now, as a full-time PCMag staffer, I'm focusing on reviewing processors and graphics cards while dabbling in all other things PC-related.,PC building, and all the ins and outs of desktop PCs,Laptop repair,Processors and motherboards,Graphics cards,PC cases,Game-console modding,As a PC component reviewer, almost every PC I use is a system that I have custom-built. The only exceptions are my laptops, which I also modify and tweak to improve their overall performance. My current laptop is a 17-inch Dell G3 gaming laptop with an Intel Core i7-8750H processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 for gaming fun.,My lifelong love of computers and gaming has led me to amass a collection of old tech devices. I have a custom-built Windows 98 PC, as well as two Windows XP systems that I still use from time to time. These sit alongside my collection of retro game consoles, which includes an NES, a Super NES, a Sega Genesis, a PS1, and an original Xbox.,I'm also something of a connoisseur of budget tech devices, which extends to my choice of smartphone. Currently, I use a Umidigi S5 Pro—a highly affordable smartphone with an OLED display that I bought for less than $200, and absolutely adore.,Whether you're upgrading your desktop PC or building a new one, choosing the right processor is the most crucial and complex choice you will make. Let's simplify it!

"Apple Mac mini (2023, M2 Pro) Review","M2 silicon elevates the tiniest Mac to new performance heights,If you’re after laptop buying advice, I’m your man. I’ve been reviewing PCs and technology products for more than a decade. I cut my teeth in PC Labs, spending several years with PCMag.com before writing for other outlets, among them LaptopMag.com and Tom’s Guide. While computers are my main focus, I’ve also written at length about topics ranging from fitness gear and appliances to TV and home theater equipment. If I’ve used it, I have opinions about it, whether somebody’s paying me to write them up or not.,With a new low price for the base model, and two peppy processor options, Apple's Mac mini offers a huge upgrade in capability while looking the same as ever. (Some good things don't need to change.),I get a sense of , every time I look at the Apple Mac mini (starts at $599; $1,799 as tested). Freshly updated for 2023 with M2 and M2 Pro processing and graphics, the most striking thing about the Mac mini may be how little the look has changed. The first one I reviewed was ,, and even ,, we were discussing the fact that it was identical to the previous model. ,But Apple isn't churning out a tired copy of a copy—far from it. Instead, the company poured its effort into what matters most: not what a machine looks like, but what it can do. And judged by that metric, the 2023 Mac mini models are a revelation, packing more power into that tiny chassis than ever before, and even doing it at a lower starting price. Don't let the samey look fool you: This isn't 2012's—or even 2020's—Mac mini. This is a fury in a minimalist chassis. It's a little dynamo-in-waiting. ,When Apple finds a design that works, especially one that fits the minimalist aesthetic that has long defined Mac products, it is slow to change. In one sense, it's about sticking with what works while cementing a brand identity, but it's also about refining product designs down to their Platonic ideal. And the Mac mini design might just be there already, a sleek-looking slab of metal with rounded corners and that polished Apple logo.,Measuring 1.4 by 7.7 by 7.7 inches (HWD), the milled-aluminum chassis doesn't take up much room. As a mini PC, that's table stakes, but the consistency of the design means that no matter where you've stashed your Mac mini before, the new one should fit right in the same spot, whether that's on your desk, in a home theater setup, slotted into a server, or used for digital signage.,There's a bit of weight difference between the newest models—the base model with the vanilla Apple M2 chip is just 2.6 pounds, but our M2 Pro version weighs 2.8 pounds—but it's still small and light enough to slip in a bag or even into a big coat pocket.,From the black-plastic foot that acts as an internal access panel (but only for official Apple techs, apparently) to the satin finish and mirrored logo, it would be easy to mistake the newest Mac mini for the half-dozen that came before. Past models have tried to differentiate a little bit with anodized finishes, and varying degrees of access to the internals, but the only real difference from one generation to the next is inside, and on the port panel in back.,But some big changes are happening this time around. They may be hidden away inside the inscrutable aluminum slab, but they are significant indeed.,Apple actually lists three new-for-2023 models on its just-updated Mac mini product page, so let's look at each.,To start with, consider the base model, the Mac mini with Apple M2. The second generation of Apple's custom-designed ,, the M2 first showed up in the 2022 versions of the , and ,, making this its first appearance in an Apple desktop. The affordable $599 model uses the standard ,, which itself is an upgrade from the previous M1 chip. Looked at side by side with the M1, the M2 adds more transistors, greater memory bandwidth, and better GPU capability. Apple pairs this with 8GB of memory and 256GB of SSD storage, which isn't much, but it's exactly what was offered on the M1 Mac mini, and Apple charged $100 more for that particular configuration.,The next step up, at $799, still uses the M2 chip and 8GB of memory, but it bumps up the storage to 512GB. Is the extra storage space worth $200? Well, that's your call to make, but we will point out that you can get many of the , for well under $200, and get 1TB of extra storage space for that money, to boot. However, internal storage isn't user-accessible or replaceable, so if you want more storage inside the compact Mac mini, you can do so only at the time of purchase.,Stepping up a bit higher is the Mac mini with M2 Pro. It's been a while since Apple offered a choice of processor options on the Mac mini, but for $1,299 you can get the more powerful M2 Pro—with its 10-core CPU and a 16-core GPU—along with 16GB of RAM and the same 512GB SSD offered on the middle model.,Now, it is worth noting that all of these options are further customizable, with the choice of additional memory and storage offered at the time you order. If you're choosing the M2 Pro model, you even get a chance to bump up to a 12-core CPU/19-core GPU version of the chip. Alternately, the M2 model can support up to 24GB of unified memory and 2TB storage, provided you're willing to pay a bit more.,Our own review unit, for example, is based on the $1,299 M2 Pro as a starting point. It adds the 12-core variant of the M2 Pro ($300 more), sticks with the 16GB of memory, and scales up the storage from 512GB to 1TB (an extra $200), bringing the total purchase price to $1,799.,The top possible configuration you could designate would have the 12-core M2 Pro, 32GB of memory, 8TB of storage, and an optional 10Gbps Ethernet connection, pricing out at a heady $4,499. And that's , just for the Mac mini and its power cable. Throw in Apple's recommended accessories, such the , ($1,999), , ($199), and the Magic Trackpad ($149) or Magic Mouse ($99), and you can tack on a couple extra grand to whatever you're paying for your particular flavor profile of Mac mini.,Granted, you don't , to do that. The Mac mini will work just fine with an older monitor or TV for a display, and a generic (or at least, cheaper) USB keyboard and mouse will do. But the whole package can be considerably more expensive than the enticing $599 price. Shop accordingly.,On the back of the Mac mini, you'll find a black rear panel covered in ports, vents, and a power button. On the base model, the connectivity loadout is identical to what's on the previous M1-powered model. But we're testing the higher-powered M2 Pro version, and here we have one of the few easy-to-spot differences between this and past Mac minis.,Our review unit comes outfitted with four , ports (an increase from the two offered on the 2021 model, as well as on the 2023 base M2 model), along with a Gigabit Ethernet jack, a full-size HDMI output, and dual USB Type-A ports.,Making use of the Thunderbolt 4 ports and the HDMI output, you can run multiple monitors off of the Mac mini, but the limitations and ceilings are different between the M2 and M2 Pro models. In simple terms, the plain-M2-based Mac minis support dual displays, while the M2 Pro models support three. But the new M2 Pro model is also the first to offer support for native resolutions up to 8K, as well as for ultra-high frame rates, letting you get 8K resolution at 60Hz, or drop the resolution to 4K to crank up the , to 240Hz. (Either option, obviously, requires a compatible display and an HDMI 2.1 cable.),You can't see it, but the Mac mini's wireless connectivity also gets a boost. The Wi-Fi support gets upgraded to ,, and the Bluetooth to Bluetooth 5.3, providing top-of-the-line performance for everything from networking to wireless peripherals.,Apple hardware comes with Apple software, and the Mac mini is no exception. The compact desktop comes with macOS ""Ventura,"" the latest version of Apple's operating system. As ever, it gives you access to Apple's rich ecosystem, nowadays with more than 15,000 apps and plug-ins, all built to work seamlessly with Apple's hardware. If you're already an Apple user, you're surely familiar with the benefits (and occasional quirks) of using Apple over Windows.,The , rolls on as ever. But for those thinking about jumping ship from Windows to Apple, there's not much to fear nowadays. At this point, software makers often cater to both Windows and Mac users. Big names like Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud have all their apps on both platforms, and the macOS apps that come with the system, such as GarageBand and Safari, are great tools in their own right. And there's always the option in the OS to use Rosetta emulation for older programs not yet optimized for Apple's chips. ,If you have very specific software needs, however, you may want to research further before jumping in. Some specialized tools don't get supported on both platforms (that's also the case for some of our usual test programs), and there is a bit of learning curve as you switch from one computing environment to the other. But don't worry. The differences are smaller than ever. (Check out , for a more in-depth look at the latest Apple software and features.),To put the new M2 Pro Mac mini through its paces, we compared it to both Apple and Windows competitors. For Apple, that means desktops as diverse as the M1-powered , to the uber-powerful ,. We also compared it with the previous ,, to help you make a decision if you're considering an upgrade.,For Windows competitors, plenty of powerful mini PC systems are on the market, but we focused on just two: the , (from HP's compact workstation line, a close analogue of the Mac mini in terms of form factor), and the , (aka, ""Wall Street Canyon,"" the latest like-sized Intel mini PC we've tested). These are two of the best tiny desktops you can buy.,We've already mentioned that Windows and Apple ecosystems do have some compatibility issues when it comes to specialized programs, and that extends to our stock testing software. Where possible, we've found tests that work on both Apple and Windows platforms, but not all of our tests span the divide, and we also have a few Mac-only tests that we use when evaluating Apple systems. If you don't see all of the systems in a given one of the test graphs below, that's why.,For gauging raw CPU muscle and productivity performance, we focus on four tests: HandBrake (video transcoding), Cinebench (multi-threaded rendering), Geekbench (an overall productivity-task simulation), and Adobe Photoshop (the classic, for image editing). ,Our HandBrake 1.4 test times how long it takes to convert a 4K video clip into a smaller 1080p copy. It's a straightforward test that leverages all of the cores and threads available on the CPU level. That makes it easy to see which systems have the better CPU performance; shorter times are better.,Then we look at Cinebench R23, using Maxon’s Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, testing multi-core and multi-threaded processing. We follow that up with Geekbench Pro, which simulates popular tasks ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Both tests produce a point score where higher scores mean better performance.,Last, we use Adobe Photoshop running in Rosetta 2. Although Adobe offers a native version of Photoshop as part of its Creative Cloud programs, our test extension, created by ,, is accessible only through Rosetta 2. So, in this case, the test is less about how fast photo editing is in the absolute, and more about how well the system can handle demanding apps that need to work through emulation. Even with that limitation, the Mac's performance compares favorably to the best Windows computers.,Scanning through the results above, it's clear from the outset that the Mac mini gets an upgrade in raw power, especially with the M2 Pro chip used in our test model, but it's still middle-of-the-road compared to some of the more powerful systems we're comparing it to. You'll see faster performance than the previous Mac mini or the iMac offered, but premium workstation-grade systems, like the M1 Ultra version of the Apple Mac Studio, or the HP Z2 Mini G9 in our tested configuration, are faster and more powerful.,That's not a surprise, given the Mac mini's midrange hardware and affordable price relative to those high-enders. What , a surprise, though, is how well the M2 Pro does at elevating the Mac mini to compete with those systems. (Thermals are thermals after all; we never expected the Mac mini to come close to topping them.) In HandBrake, the Mac mini edged ahead of the Mac Studio (the M1 Max version) and is closing in on the HP Z2 Mini G9—both truly astonishing results from a system that costs less than $2,000. (The M1 Ultra version of the Mac Studio does prevail by a wide margin, mind you.),The same thing was repeated in Cinebench and Geekbench, where the Mac mini managed to get within spitting distance of genuine workstation-grade compact desktops. And in Photoshop, the overall scores were surprisingly close across the board. (And the two highest scorers, in the M1 Ultra-based Mac Studio and the HP Z2 Mini G9, had a , more RAM.),Now, I'm not saying that the M2 Pro lets you use the Mac mini as a full-fledged workstation. But I am saying that it does well enough at some demanding tasks that you may no longer need a workstation, unless you spend all day in these kinds of tasks (and thus, every moment saved is money), and your specific profession requires things like software ISV certifications and error-correcting memory (say, architecture or engineering). If it's about having the power to edit photos and videos, do a little music production at home, or do some serious number crunching or even software development, don't discount the Mac mini. It just might be able to handle everything you need it to do.,For graphics testing across existing Apple platforms, we start with the 3DMark testing suite from UL, specifically its Wild Life Extreme subtest. Wild Life Extreme runs natively on Apple Silicon to benchmark graphics performance across models and generations of Mac. Running in Unlimited mode, the test is resolution-agnostic, so we can compare systems using the 5K Studio Display as well as we can to iMacs or a MacBook's 13-inch screen, making it a great leveling measure of performance. The test produces a total score, with higher scores denoting better performance.,For cross-platform graphics evaluation, we use GFXBench. The Apple version of this test uses Apple’s Metal graphics API, and it stress-tests both low-level routines such as texturing, and high-level, game-like image rendering. Just as important, it lets us compare numbers directly to the OpenGL-based version of GFXBench that we use for Windows testing. On this test's results, the more frames per second (fps), the better.,Finally, actual gaming. The number of Mac-compatible games that have built-in benchmarking tools is small, so we currently use just the one test to get a sense of the system's actual gaming capabilities. (We'll follow up with more in-depth graphics testing later.) We record the average frames per second (fps) at different detail settings. Here, higher frame-rate numbers are better.,The charts lay out the situation pretty well: When it comes to gaming on Mac desktops, we're looking at the Mac mini and the Mac Studio. Everything else can offer , gaming support, but not at the detail levels and high frame rates that real gamers will appreciate. Obviously, the Mac mini isn't as potent as either version of the Mac Studio, but for a compact desktop that sells for a fraction of the price of the Mac Studio in a much trimmer body, the Mac mini is a little beast.,It offered better GFXBench scores than either the HP Z2 Mini G9 or the Intel NUC 12 Pro, and it nearly tripled the score of the previous Mac mini with M1. And it did the same in Rise of the Tomb Raider, delivering superb gaming performance unlike anything you'll find in comparable Windows systems of this size.,The other test we've run on Apple's more premium Macs is Blender, an open-source 3D suite for modeling, animation, simulation, and compositing. In this test, we simulate a common workstation task, recording the time it takes for its built-in Cycles path tracer to render two photo-realistic scenes of BMW cars, one render using the system's CPU and one relying on the GPU. (In both cases, lower times are better.),This test is considerably more demanding than your average gaming benchmark, and a test we normally reserve for workstation systems. But since we wanted to see how the M2 Pro compares to the M1 Max and M1 Ultra, it seemed worthwhile to run it.,Here's where we really saw something surprising. The M2 Pro-powered Mac mini managed to just about keep up with a legitimate compact workstation, the HP Z2 Mini G9. It even held its own against the M1 Max-powered Mac Studio. (Not so much against the M1 Ultra one, though.),As I noted earlier, the Mac mini is, of course, not technically a ""workstation"" in the classic sense. But at these levels of raw performance, it may fill the needs of many amateur and professional creators who need more power than the usual system can provide, but may not have the budget to plonk down $3,000 to $4,000 for a proper workstation tower.,It's easy to look at the unchanging design of the 2023 Mac mini and write it off as staid and unchanged from years past, without appreciating the enormous strides in capability that Apple has provided with Apple Silicon. The outward design may be the same, but the new Mac mini may be the best little Apple desktop we've seen, offering an astounding amount of power in a classic chassis.,Obviously, that sort of performance costs money, and the rip-roaring configuration of the Mac mini we tested is considerably dearer—indeed, exactly three times so—than the $599 price of the base model. But bear in mind that some of that $1,799 is down to the uptick in SSD storage (which you may or may not need), and the other to the kicked-up CPU/GPU combo; in the $1,299 M2 Pro, we'd still expect very good performance in tests that lean hard on the CPU with the 10-core M2 Pro. But whether you're looking at the cheapest option, or one of the surprisingly powerful M2 Pro flavors, it's clear that Apple's latest M2 chips are bringing shoppers more power than ever before.,With a new low price for the base model, and two peppy processor options, Apple's Mac mini offers a huge upgrade in capability while looking the same as ever.

NordVPN Review,"An expensive but powerful VPN,Since my start in 2008, I've covered a wide variety of topics from space missions to fax service reviews. At PCMag, much of my work has been focused on security and privacy services, as well as a video game or two. I also write the occasional security columns, focused on making information security practical for normal people. I helped organize the Ziff Davis Creators Guild union and currently serve as its Unit Chair.,As a PCMag security analyst, I report on security solutions such as password managers and parental control software, as well as privacy tools such as VPNs. Each week I send out the , newsletter filled with online security news and tips for keeping you and your family safe on the internet. ,NordVPN packs numerous privacy features into a slick client and continues to roll out new tools to customers. It's a privacy juggernaut, but at a premium price., A , can help improve your privacy online by making you harder to track and preventing your ISP from snooping on your online activities. NordVPN offers a bit of everything on top of that basic VPN protection. It has a large and diverse collection of servers, an impressive arsenal of rarely seen tools, as well as strong privacy and security practices. Some of NordVPN's advanced features, like Meshnet, are unique and help justify its high cost. Others, like Threat Protection, were lacking. Finally the company continues to release third-party audits, which encourage trust in its service. Taken all together, NordVPN remains an Editors' Choice winner.,Like many VPN companies, NordVPN has expanded beyond VPN protection and now offers the , password manager and , encrypted file storage. NordVPN now offers these services bundled with a VPN subscription. The Standard plan ($11.99 per month or $67.35 for the first year and $99.48 ,) includes just VPN protection. The Plus tier ($12.99 per month or $82.35 for the first year and then $126.96 per year) adds the NordPass password manager and data breach scanning à la HaveIBeenPwned. The Complete tier ($14.29 per month or $101.85 for the first year and then $198.84 per year) throws in 1TB of encrypted cloud storage. NordVPN also offers two-year subscriptions for $99.63, $126.63, and $161.73 for the Standard, Plus, and Complete tiers. These renew at their respective annual rates on a per-year basis. ,Although it might be enticing to do so, we recommend against immediately springing for discounted long-term plans. Instead, start with a short term plan so you can try out the VPN service in your home.,You can pay with Amazon Pay, all major credit cards, cryptocurrencies via CoinGate, Google Pay, PayPal, and Plaid. As of this writing, the average cost for a VPN service we've reviewed is about $9.78 per month and $65.82 per year. This puts NordVPN on the pricey side, no matter which tier you choose or the length of your subscription.,You can absolutely get a top VPN ,. Editors' Choice winner ,, for instance, is just 5 euro ($5.31 USD at time of writing) per month, and top pick Proton VPN has all the same features as NordVPN for just $9.99 per month. At $23.88, Opera VPN Pro has the lowest annual fee of any non-free VPN we've tested.,There are also some , worthy of consideration. While all free VPNs have limitations, Proton VPN is the one of the very few we've tested that doesn't limit the amount of data free subscribers can use. ,, stating that scammers were taking advantage of it.,NordVPN allows you to use up to six devices simultaneously. The average VPN service limits you to five such connections, but that's starting to change. ,, ,, Editors' Choice winners Surfshark VPN and TunnelBear VPN allow an unlimited number of devices to connect at once.,NordVPN offers static IP addresses for $8.99 per month ($63.48 per year). You can choose an address for Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, or the United States. A static IP address may help prevent your VPN connection from being blocked, especially if you connect to the same region consistently. While other VPN services offer static IPs as add-ons, the process is , with NordVPN and a real miss from a customer service standpoint.,One excellent aspect of NordVPN is the variety of additional tools it provides for improving your privacy. NordVPN, Proton VPN, and VPNArea are the only three VPN companies we've tested that provide direct access to the Tor anonymization network. This makes it even harder to trace your connection, and it lets you access hidden websites, though at greatly reduced speeds. You can, however, ,.,NordVPN also supports multi-hop connections, which it calls Double VPN. This routes your connection through a second VPN server instead of just one. That way, if one leg of the connection is somehow compromised, you can rest assured that your connection is still secure. ,Split-tunneling lets you designate which apps route their traffic through the VPN connection, and which travel in the clear. NordVPN takes an interesting approach with this feature, letting you either require or forbid VPN connections for apps. NordVPN and , are among the very few products that offer split tunneling, access to Tor via VPN server, and multi-hop connections.,NordVPN includes , (previously branded as ""CyberSec""), which go beyond typical VPN protection. The company claims these features can block malicious sites, detect malware, and ,. Other companies, such as Surfshark VPN have expanded into similar territory, while some antivirus companies have gone the opposite direction and started including VPNs with their traditional antivirus products. As we explain, we found NordVPN's Threat Protection features lacking, and recommend using standalone antivirus instead. Note that the NordVPN app says that this is a Beta feature, so its performance may change.,NordVPN recently announced a new feature called ,, which allows you to connect to one of your own devices via VPN. NordVPN has also created a system where you can share access to your device with other NordVPN members you approve. That's distinct from Hola VPN, and others, that use customers as exit nodes for connections. The company suggests that this could be handy for remote file access and collaboration, or even LAN gaming over great distances. We think the most practical application will be accessing the web via a home computer while you're traveling abroad. Additionally, NordVPN is now allowing customers to roll-their-own self-hosted NordVPN instance.,In addition to the platforms mentioned in this review, NordVPN supports ,. You can also configure some routers to connect via NordVPN. Doing so supplies coverage for all the devices on your network, including smart home devices that can't run a VPN on their own.,Although useful, a VPN can't protect against all ills. We highly recommend activating , wherever possible, creating complex and unique passwords for each site and service with a ,, and using ,.,NordVPN uses NordLynx (an implementation of WireGuard) by default in its Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows apps. OpenVPN is also available on all those platforms. IKEv2 is available for iOS and macOS apps only.,OpenVPN has long been the gold standard for VPNs, but , is increasingly popular. It's easy to see why: like OpenVPN, WireGuard is open source, but it uses newer encryption techniques and yields better speeds.,NordVPN boasts servers in , and provides good geographic diversity with its servers. Still, other VPN companies outshine it. ,, for example, covers 94 countries and HMA VPN about 190.,The bulk of NordVPN's servers are in the US and the UK, which is not unusual for VPN companies. However, NordVPN also has a sizable mix of servers the world over. The company currently offers one location in Africa (South Africa), a continent ignored by most other VPN services. ,Notably, NordVPN offers servers in ,, Turkey, and Vietnam, all of which have restrictive internet policies. The company does not offer servers in ,, but it does have servers in ,. Note that we don't make a specific recommendation for a ,, because the stakes of getting it wrong are simply too high. ,NordVPN's collection adds up to about 5,400 servers, but , network of some 9,600 servers leads the pack. More servers do not necessarily mean better service, but having numerous options can be useful. You may be more likely to find one near you, and the one that's near you is less likely to be bogged down by too many users.,As far as the machines themselves go, NordVPN recently added several 10Gbps servers to its fleet, replacing some 1Gbps machines. The company says this effort will help handle the increase in data that will come as , more broadly. We're interested to see how this develops.,One topic that often comes up when counting VPN fleets is virtual servers and virtual locations. Virtual servers are software-defined servers, and several can be hosted on a single machine. A virtual location is a server configured to appear somewhere other than where it is physically located. Neither is , problematic, but we prefer companies to be transparent about their infrastructure. A NordVPN representative told us all its servers are dedicated, not virtual, and none are virtual locations. That means the servers are physically located where they claim to be, which is what we want to see.,NordVPN is working to move all its servers to co-located facilities, meaning it will eventually own all its physical infrastructure. Other companies can already boast of owning their servers, but none are as large as NordVPN. The company tells us this process is ongoing and that 12% of its servers are co-located. ,In 2020, the company completed its transition to diskless or ""RAM only"" servers. This is a tamper-resistant measure; nothing is written to disk, so nothing can be obtained from seizing the servers. ExpressVPN and a few other companies also employ this technique. NordVPN's Privacy Policy also outlines some infrastructure protections as well.,If it desired, a VPN company could examine every bit of information passing through its system. For each review, we look over the company's privacy policy and discuss security and privacy issues directly with the company. We didn't find anything worrisome, although NordVPN's policy is less reader friendly than TunnelBear VPN's.,In our discussions with the company and in its privacy policy, NordVPN makes clear that it does not log ""browsing history, traffic information, or IP addresses used to access the internet via our services."" That's as it should be.,The NordVPN , states that the company does not log connection session information, used bandwidth, traffic logs, IP addresses, or browsing data. Instead, NordVPN retains the username and time of the last session, but only for 15 minutes after you disconnect from the VPN. That's good. This was verified by a third-party audit, outlined below. A representative from NordVPN assured us the company does not profit from the sale of user data. The company does not generate revenue from sources other than customer subscriptions. ,NordVPN is incorporated in and operates under the legal jurisdiction of Panama (the company says it maintains offices in other countries in addition to Panama). Panama has no legal requirement for companies to retain data for any given period. The company says that were it to be subpoenaed, it would only respond to a court order or subpoena issued by a Panamanian court. ,In 2022, NordVPN , to clarify that it does respond to requests from law enforcement after previously stating otherwise. When we reached out to NordVPN, the company reiterated its position that the company is not able to log user activity. To do so would require NordVPN to rearrange its infrastructure, an eventuality the company says is extremely unlikely.,NordVPN's privacy policy clearly lays out the third parties it works with that might receive information about its customers, which is fairly common practice. Mullvad VPN, notably, has taken extreme measures to avoid retaining any customer information, including dropping support for recurring subscriptions.,NordVPN has made it easier to find more information on its structure and corporate leadership. Much of that information can be found at the ,. A company representative told us that it is owned by nordvpn s.a. (formerly Tefincom S.A.). NordVPN does not issue transparency reports about requests for information by law enforcement, but it does maintain a , indicating it , any National Security letters, gag orders, or government-issued warrants.,On February 2, 2022, NordVPN announced it was merging with Editors' Choice winner Surfshark VPN. A press release from the two companies said the new relationship would allow them to develop better products and focus on different market segments. ""Both companies will continue to operate autonomously and rely on separate infrastructure and product roadmaps,"" said the press release. PCMag reporter Michael Kan was told this was ,. Both companies (nordvpn s.a. and Surfshark VPN) will be owned by Cyberspace, a holding company registered in the Netherlands.,In October 2019, it came to light that an attacker remotely accessed one of NordVPN's servers. NordVPN says there is no evidence the attacker obtained anything significant. We discuss the attack, and its consequences, in much greater detail in a feature article about the ,. The company has since invested significant time and capital into hardening its systems and practices, including the moves to its own server clusters and diskless servers.,NordVPN has initiated a ,, paying out cash rewards to researchers who find flaws in its system. PriceWaterhouseCooper has completed two audits of NordVPN in 2018 and 2020. Notably, it included an audit of NordVPN's server infrastructure and concluded the company was indeed living up to its claims of not logging user data or information. NordVPN has also released the results from several penetration testing audits on its client software by VerSprite as recently as 2021. Finally, in January 2023, NordVPN released an , that verified the company was complying with its commitment to not log user activity. ,, but they are still a measure of accountability we appreciate. We're pleased to see that NordVPN continues to release third-party audits, although we'd like to see them make the same public commitment to annual audits TunnelBear VPN has made. We'd also like to see a more recent audit of the company's infrastructure and policies, especially given the new features in the product and the acquisition of Surfshark VPN. The company tells us new audits are forthcoming.,For testing NordVPN on Windows, we used an Intel , desktop running the latest version of Windows 11. We had no trouble setting up NordVPN. Notably, the app has you log in through the company's web portal, saving you the irritation of cutting and pasting your login from your password manager.,The Windows client visually echoes the NordVPN mobile apps, with a monochrome blue map as its focus. A recent update removed the whimsical flourishes, which included submarines and ships on cartoon seas. It's more polished than, say, TunnelBear VPN, though the latter has charm NordVPN can't match.,The NordVPN Windows app seeks a middle ground between fine-grained control and set-and-forget simplicity. You can change servers by clicking a location on the map, or you can use the search bar at the top of the screen if your geography skills are lacking. You can connect to the fastest server, the fastest server in a particular country, or even a specific server. The app shows the load on each, directing you toward an unburdened option. This is great for ,, and it lets you hunt around in case a server is blocked. Our only complaint? It's all done through a series of tiny drop-down menus. We'd rather the app took up some extra real estate to spare our poor eyes.,The NordVPN app Kill Switch shuts off access to the internet for specific applications, should your computer become disconnected from the VPN. Another handy feature is the option to pause your connection. This disconnects you from the VPN and then reconnects you after an interval you select.,NordVPN's Split Tunneling feature lets you require a VPN connection for certain apps, or route the traffic of some apps outside the VPN. The NordVPN app shows a handy list of the applications currently running, making it easy to add them to the Split Tunneling list.,We are pleased that NordVPN's new Meshnet feature was easy to set up in testing. On the Windows app, we enabled Meshnet and were assigned a unique ID. This device was now ready to act as a VPN exit point. On a Google Pixel 3a, we installed the NordVPN Android app and our Windows machine appeared as an option under traffic routing. We selected it and were connected in seconds. We could easily see the device was connected in the Windows app, and appreciated there were options to block the device. We confirmed our phone now had the same IP address as our Windows machine. We did not explore the option of inviting a different NordVPN user to use our connection.,While surprisingly easy to use, the Meshnet interface could use some additional work. It wasn't always immediately clear which device was which, and how the traffic was routed. Although we can imagine contexts where this feature would make sense, it's more intriguing than immediately compelling. We're curious what consumers will make of it and where NordVPN will take Meshnet in the future.,When We tested NordVPN, we had no trouble streaming Netflix video while connected to a US server. But the , is ongoing, and results can change from day to day.,One concern is that ,. In testing, NordVPN successfully changed our IP address and hid our ISP information. The DNS leak test tool indicated the server we were connected to did not leak our DNS information.,NordVPN Threat Protection “guards you as you browse the web” in two ways. First, it diverts your browser from known dangerous pages. Second, it scans any files you download and deletes those it recognizes as malware. But does it work? We put it to the test in the same way we evaluate any antivirus product.,This test starts with a collection of malware-hosting web pages supplied by the researchers at,. Typically, the URLs are no more than a few days old. We launch each URL, discarding any that don’t load properly, and note what the security product does. If it blocks access to the website or eliminates the malware download, it gets a point, but if it sits idly by, ignoring the danger, it gets nothing. After testing 100 links we run the numbers.,NordVPN’s results were thoroughly unimpressive. Threat Protection only blocked 6% of the samples by diverting the browser from the malware-hosting URL. It eliminated another 55% by identifying and deleting the malware payload, for a total of 61%. Only a handful of products have scored lower, , among them. We should note again that NordVPN's app says Threat Protection is a beta feature, so its performance may be variable.,At the other end of the spectrum, McAfee, Norton, Sophos, and ZoneAlarm all scored 100% in this test. ZoneAlarm’s score is noteworthy because it handled every single case by analyzing and eliminating the malware download.,Threat Protection also promises to keep your web surfing free of ads and trackers. To check the ad blocking feature we simply visited several ad-heavy websites on a system with NordVPN installed and on another system with no ad blocking component. The ad blocker visibly did its job, removing inline ads, popup ads, slide-in ads, and more.,Most products that offer to block trackers on the web use a browser extension that lets you, the user, interact with the tracking system. Commonly, the extension’s toolbar button displays the number of trackers on the current page. Clicking that button gets you a more detailed list, sometimes with the ability to pick and choose which trackers or tracker types to block. ,While it doesn’t require a VPN connection, NordVPN’s Threat Protection works below the browser level, so there’s no way to see stats about its tracker blocking activity. We can see it's doing something—we just can’t verify that as an empirical fact. ,When you use a VPN, it , affect your web browsing performance. To get a sense of how great an impact a VPN has, we conduct a series of speed tests using the , tool. We explain our methodology in our piece on ,.,We found NordVPN reduced download speed test results by 3.4% and it reduced upload speed test results by 4.4%. It had a mere 1.4% increase on latency scores—likely a result of its large collection of servers.,The chart below shows the most recent results. Our , mean we'll update the chart throughout the year with new results and new products.,You can find a full breakdown of our speed test results in our feature on the ,. That said, speed shouldn't be the only criteria you use to choose a VPN. Value, ease of use, and commitment to privacy are more important factors. NordVPN, however, thinks measuring VPN speeds is very important and has released , so anyone can do it. We don't agree with all NordVPN's views on speed testing and prefer a more real-world approach. However, this kind of work to standardize and demystify VPN evaluations is sorely needed by the industry and we're grateful to see the investment.,When testing the , client for NordVPN, we used a MacBook Air (M1, 2020) running OS Big Sur version 11.2.2, and NordVPN’s app performed well. The whimsical map on the MacOS app looks just like the mobile version of the app, but it has a light background instead of a dark one.,NordVPN’s macOS app is notable in its simplicity. After logging in and agreeing to give access to your Apple Keychain, you can Quick Connect to any of NordVPN’s many servers around the globe. If you want a bit more control over your experience, you can scroll through the list of countries on the left side of the app window, choose a country, and open a drop-down menu that reveals a list of all the servers in that country. It’s easier to just choose a spot on the map and use the VPN server located there, but it’s useful that the macOS version gives you a choice when it comes to servers.,As with the iOS app, the macOS app doesn’t appear to leak your true DNS information. We checked this out with a server in Sweden by visiting the DNS Leak Test site and using its Extended Test tool, and we didn't find any leaks.,The speed and performance were both excellent with the two servers we tried while testing. We were able to browse Weverse and stream BTS videos and other content without interruptions. The videos loaded a little slower than they do on our normal home connection, but otherwise, we saw little to no difference in our online experience when using NordVPN for macOS.,NordVPN for iPhone makes connecting to a VPN easy. To test this iPhone VPN, we used an iPhone XS running iOS 14.8.1. In light mode, the app’s color scheme is bright white and gray with green and blue accents. With dark mode, the background changes to black and the gray map turns navy blue. The iOS app is very user-friendly. All features, from the new Meshnet to standards such as auto-connect, have accompanying text explaining their purpose in easy-to-understand terms. ,The navigation bar at the bottom of the dashboard includes four icons: Connection, Meshnet, Statistics, and User Profile. In the Connection section, you can choose a VPN server by tapping on the country and city. There’s also a Pause button, which allows you to disconnect from your VPN for a predetermined period and reconnect automatically after time is up.,Next, we tested the Meshnet connection feature using the iOS app. When we tested the app, you could only route traffic through Windows or Linux devices. For the test, we attempted to access a Windows machine using NordVPN’s Meshnet. Both devices had the same IP address after establishing a connection. ,The Statistics icon opens up a page of fun facts about your VPN usage, including how much time you spend connected to a VPN. The user profile page is where you can enable features such as the Dark Web Monitor and Threat Protection (a malware blocker). You can also enable multi-factor authentication for your account from the Profile screen, increasing the Security Score located at the top of the screen.,We ran an extended test on DNSLeakTest.com to see if NordVPN was leaking our real IP address or DNS requests. We didn’t find any leaks while connected to a server in Iceland. While connected to the same server, we also watched several YouTube videos and Twitch streams. The connection remained fast and stable throughout the viewing time.,NordVPN’s , features an interactive gray world map for a background, its landscape dotted by cities with a NordVPN server presence. The app has a lot of features, including split-tunneling, a Kill Switch, tapjacking protection, a dark web monitor, a security checklist, and it also allows you to create a custom DNS setup.,The Android app gives you a little more choice when it comes to servers than the iPhone app, but not as much freedom as the Windows version. You can choose the city where your VPN server is located, but there is not a list of servers to choose from. NordVPN will connect you to the fastest server in that city. ,When you turn on Meshnet, it creates a Nord name and an IP address for your device so you can connect to it the same way you would connect to a NordVPN server. When we tested this feature, we could only connect to a device running NordVPN's desktop software from the mobile app.,Using a Samsung A71 5G device running Android 12, we tested for DNS leaks using the DNS Leak Test Tool while connected to a VPN server in Toronto, Canada. The server did not leak our DNS information and successfully hid our true IP address. While connected to the server in Toronto, we were also able to play YouTube videos and stream live videos from Twitch.tv without interruptions or slow loading times.,We downloaded the NordVPN Android app for Chrome OS onto a Dell Chrome 3100 with an Intel Celeron Processor. NordVPN on Chrome OS is a full-featured VPN application that includes a multi-factor authentication option for its users. The app calculates customers’ security scores on startup and walks them through turning on various app features to raise their security levels. ,Features include split tunneling, a Kill Switch, a Dark Web Monitor, and Threat Protection, which blocks malicious websites. The app also includes tapjacking protection, which warns users when an app uses a screen overlay to trick them into performing an unintended action, such as clicking on a malicious link.,For ,, NordVPN offers NordLayer. This service starts with a Basic account for $7 per user per month, billed annually at $84. Advanced accounts add more features—most notably, dedicated servers—and costs $9 per user per month, billed annually at $108. Adding a dedicated server to an Advanced account costs an additional $40 per month.,Part of NordLayer is a ""cloud VPN,"" meaning there's no on-site hardware. Instead, employees connect to one NordLayer's servers and are routed to the internal corporate network. This lets you access local resources as if you were sitting in your office. Single sign-on access, multi-factor authentication, and VPN auto-connect are also included with a NordLayer subscription.,NordVPN faces the stiffest competition the industry has yet seen. Services like Editors' Choice winners , and , drastically undercut NordVPN on price, while , offers all the same features for less. , and ,, meanwhile, place no limit on the number of simultaneous connections. ,What has always been NordVPN's strength, though, is that it offers all the best features of the competition in one flexible package. With NordVPN, you have access to advanced tools and features, or you can simply set it and forget it. The company is also reaping the benefits of incorporating new technology like WireGuard into its core products and is looking to expand with new consumer features like Meshnet. It has some misses, however. We weren't impressed with its Threat Protection features, and would like to see the company complete new audits. But when taken together, all these pieces add up to an excellent product. NordVPN remains an Editors' Choice winner. ,NordVPN packs numerous privacy features into a slick client and continues to roll out new tools to customers.

AMD Ryzen 7 7700 Review,"A fierce midrange CPU duel that Intel wins...with a Core i5,For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming. I began working on computers owned by immediate family members and relatives when I was around 10 years old. I've always sought to learn as much as possible about anything PC, leading to a well-rounded grasp on all things tech today. In my role at PCMag, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to share what I know.,AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 is a respectable processor with a worthy stock cooler and fast performance, especially in games, but it can't quite topple the Intel Core i5-13600K, which matches it in price.,AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 ($329) processor is a fine CPU with a decent stock cooler and fast-enough performance, but can it compete with Intel's latest ""Raptor Lake"" 13th Generation chips? At launch, AMD’s Ryzen 7000-series , were exceptional and exciting. For a hot minute, the , was the world’s fastest consumer processor, and the gains over the previous generation were impressive. This all made the new Ryzen 7000-series chips revolutionary at launch. ,But the market changed quickly when Intel's Raptor Lake processors arrived. Their better performance and lower prices have undermined, to an extent, the appeal of AMD's Ryzen 7000-series chips. While the AMD Ryzen 7 7700 is quite the capable performer, thanks to the new redlines that Intel has drawn, it's not as fast as we would expect for the price, and can't quite keep up with its 13th Gen pricing counterpart: an overclockable Core i5 stocked with more cores, thanks to Intel's addition of Efficient cores (E-cores). Still, its inclusion of a good stock cooler (which the rival , lacks) makes it a viable pick in its price range, if you want to go with the AMD AM5 platform.,Like all AMD Ryzen 7000-series processors, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700 utilizes the ,. We covered this architecture in more detail in our review of the ,, and we recommend you check out that review if you are interested in learning more about Zen 4.,In brief, Zen 4 is AMD’s latest high-performance microarchitecture. It continues to use chiplets, just like previous iterations of the Zen architecture, but it shows improved performance per clock. It also helps that Zen 4 processors can run at higher clock speeds, which, coupled with the increase in IPC, results in an average of a 29% performance increase over ""Zen 3""-based Ryzen 5000-series processors. All Ryzen 7000-series processors are built on TSMC’s 5nm manufacturing process.,AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 processor comes equipped with eight CPU cores that can operate two threads each, for a total of 16. The cores are set with a base clock of 3.8GHz and can operate at 5.3GHz right out of the box. Support for DDR5 memory is standard on all Ryzen 7000-series processors, with the Ryzen 7 7700 supporting memory clocked at 5,200MHz. Also jammed inside the processor is 32MB of L3 cache and a relatively low-end, Radeon RDNA 2-based integrated graphics processor (IGP).,AMD’s Ryzen 7 7700 processor was tested on our updated AMD testbed, which is built on an , motherboard with a , 240mm water cooler. The system contains 32GB (2x16GB) of G.Skill DDR5 RAM clocked at the processor’s max supported RAM speed of 5,200MHz. The whole system is powered by a , power supply, and the parts are installed on a Praxis Wetbench open-air testbed.,An , graphics card was also installed in the system and used for most tests. It worked as the GPU in all gaming tests except those focused on the integrated graphics portion of the processor, and it also served as the display adapter for all non-graphics-related tests.,Picking the closest competitor for the Ryzen 7 7700 is tricky, as AMD's and Intel’s specs have diverged considerably in recent years. Usually, Ryzen 7 processors are set to go head-to-head against Intel’s Core i7 processors, but we haven’t tested the new Core i7-13700K quite yet. The Core i7-12700K nonetheless should bring stern competition for the Ryzen 7 7700, and so should the ,. In terms of power, however, it’s notable that none of the other processors in the list comes close to matching the Ryzen 7 7700's listed board power.,We start with AIDA64’s memory benchmark, as it gives us some insight into the inner workings of the processor. It’s important to note that different architectures deal with changes in bandwidth differently, and as such these numbers aren’t that comparable to those of most other processors.,Regardless, comparing processors that have the same architecture is very straightforward, and here you can see the Ryzen 7 7700 lags slightly behind the , across the board in memory performance.,The rest of the CPU-focused tests are far more telling about processor performance. Starting with Cinebench R23, it’s clear that the Ryzen 7 7700 easily outpaces the older AMD Ryzen 5000-series processors, and that it has a healthy edge over the Intel Core i5-12600K. This helps to plainly show the generational improvements in the Zen 4 architecture, but the performance gains aren’t enough for the Ryzen 7 7700 to outpace the Core i7-12700K or the Core i5-13600K in most tests, both of which are significantly faster.,In our Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro tests, the Ryzen 7 7700 puts up a better fight, and it manages to outpace the Core i7-12700K in the Photoshop test. It also comes closer to its competition in the Premiere Pro test, but the Core i7-12700K remains faster there, and the Core i5-13600K is faster than the Ryzen 7 7700 in both tests.,In both Handbrake and Blender, the Ryzen 7 7700 is once again significantly slower than the Core i7-12700K and the Core i5-13600K. Things are slightly better in POV-Ray 3.7, but the best that can be said for the Ryzen 7 7700 there is that it doesn't lose by quite as large of a margin in the single-threaded test.,Overall, the Ryzen 7 7700 is one of the fastest eight-core processors that we've tested to date, but in most tests it just can't top the power of the 14 cores packed inside of Intel's Core i5-13600K. The Core i5, like many other Raptor Lake chips, uses an unconventional core configuration with six of what Intel calls Performance cores (or P-cores) and eight Efficient cores (E-cores). As their name suggests, the E-cores aren't quite as fast as the P-cores, and they also aren't in the same league as AMD's full-fat Zen 4 CPU cores. But like an army of worker ants, they can do some impressive things when they work together, and this is what boosts the Core i5's performance over the Ryzen 7 7700.,Overall, the Ryzen 7 7700’s performance proves to be somewhat lackluster in a relative sense. This is not because it has poor performance, but because it has better-performing competition. The differences in CPU tests vary from relatively small to considerable, but the game tests show less variation.,Skipping past 3DMark, which is a synthetic test and not indicative of real-world performance, in F1 22, the Ryzen 7 7700 is 5% faster than the Ryzen 9 7950X and the Ryzen 7 7700X at all resolutions. This is a small lead and one that would hardly be worth mentioning if it weren’t for the significantly lower price of the Ryzen 7 7700 than those two aforementioned CPUs. None of the rest of the tests shows more than a 2% difference among the three Ryzen 7000-series chips.,There isn't much variation between the Core i5-13600K and the Ryzen 7 7700. All test scores from these two chips are within the 3% margin of error and effectively render the differences practically nonexistent. The one exception to this is in Bioshock: Infinite at 1080p, where the Core i5-13600K is slightly faster, with a still-modest 4% lead over the Ryzen 7 7700.,With these results, it’s fair to say that you can expect to get about the same gaming experience from the Core i5-13600K or the Ryzen 7 7700—or several of these other processors. This should be true if you have a GPU on par with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 that we used for testing, but this may not quite hold up if you have a particularly powerful GPU, like an , or an ,.,We’re not going to dwell too much on the performance of the IGP AMD is shipping with most of its Ryzen 7000-series processors. We’ve tested it before, and we tested it again with nearly the same results. Overall, the IGP is exceptionally underpowered for a modern IGP, and it's only really suited for non-gaming tasks or games that have more than a decade of age on them. It's really designed just to light up a monitor for everyday tasks.,We measure the power consumption of the test system using a Kill-A-Watt power meter, which shows the Ryzen 7 7700 to be one of the more energy-efficient processors we’ve tested in recent years. In Adobe Premiere, we get a mixture of CPU and GPU work that cranks up the power consumption and causes it to pull more power than the Core i5-13600K.,In Cinebench, which is entirely CPU-driven, we get a far lower power reading for the Ryzen 7 7700. Intel can justify some of this by the Core i5-13600K’s higher Cinebench test score, which is a full 25% above the Ryzen 7 7700’s test score. That doesn’t quite make up for consuming roughly 46% more power than the Ryzen 7 7700, though, which does mean that the Ryzen 7 7700 likely has better efficiency and performance per watt overall.,Higher power consumption also means higher heat production, and this is evident in the thermal test we perform in Cinebench. It shows the Ryzen 7 7700 at just 71 degrees Celsius (C) to the Core i5-13600K’s 85 degrees C. That’s a 20% increase in temperature from the Ryzen 7 7700 to the Core i5-13600K even with both processors being cooled by identical coolers.,AMD ships the Ryzen 7 7700 with a Wraith Prism CPU cooler, which is quite capable. It features a copper baseplate with copper heat pipes and a larger heatsink than you would typically expect to see on a stock cooler. The fan is also fairly quiet and has some RGB LED flair.,A noticeable stigma has risen against stock coolers, building up over the years from the use of some rather lackluster coolers by AMD, Intel, and various system manufacturers in the last several decades. But not all stock coolers are made the same, as AMD makes clear. The key point to this test is to see if you need to buy a separate cooler or if the one AMD supplies will work for you.,Thermally, the AMD Wraith Prism performs excellently while cooling the AMD Ryzen 7 7700. It isn't able to keep pace with the Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux that we use for all CPUs that we review, but it does well enough. The Ryzen 7 7700 doesn't exceed 78 degrees C during the Cinebench R23 test, and the performance difference shown between testing with the two coolers is negligible, at less than a 2% difference.,Given its performance, the Wraith Prism cooler should be sufficient for most of you who buy the Ryzen 7 7700. I wouldn’t hesitate to even use it for some amount of overclocking, but if you are going to do more extreme overclocking—or if you are building in a compact system with limited internal airflow—you may want to consider a water cooler.,Before we can close out this review, there’s still one key detail that we still need to discuss in greater detail, and that’s the price. The Ryzen 7 7700 has an MSRP of $329 and, with its performance numbers, it’s easily a better option than AMD’s Ryzen 7 7700X. It costs considerably less than the Ryzen 7 7700X even before you count the value of the stock cooler, which the Ryzen 7 7700X does not ship with. The Ryzen 7 7700 also stays far cooler during operation, consumes far less power, and performs similarly.,Against Intel’s Core i7-12700K, it’s a bit tougher of comparison as the Core i7-12700K overall is capable of better performance than the Ryzen 7 7700. The Core i7-12700K is priced considerably higher too, though, at $409, and this arguably makes the Ryzen 7 7700 the better option when you consider how much performance you get for what you pay.,The biggest problem for the Ryzen 7 7700, however, is the Core i5-13600K, which is also priced at $329 and has a strong performance lead over the Ryzen 7 7700. Realistically, weighing the options, the Core i5-13600K is the better option here. The Ryzen 7 7700 may have a small niche where it can gain some traction, as the Core i5-13600K doesn’t come with a stock cooler and would require you to buy a cooler for it, which does offset the price of the two chips somewhat. Coolers aren’t all that expensive, though—at least bulky air-coolers aren’t—and it’s debatable if this added cost is enough to give the Ryzen 7 7700 a worthwhile edge to draw you away from the Core i5.,The Ryzen 7 7700’s lower power consumption could also attract some customers looking to build compact energy-efficient systems. Considering it as a solution for an office building that will want to keep system size, heat production, and power consumption all to a minimum, the Ryzen 7 7700 looks like a real winner in this area. At the same time, however, it’s a less-than-ideal option for a home theater PC, due to its lackluster IGP.,AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 may seem like an attractive office power-user solution, but it’s in a tight spot on all other fronts. Like AMD’s other Ryzen 7000-series chips, a price cut would help it better compete with Intel’s more powerful Raptor Lake processors. It’s not a bad option, by any means, and if you are a fan of AMD—or just want to save a bit while building your gaming PC by avoiding buying a stock cooler—the Ryzen 7 7700 is a decent option. If you’re out for the best performance you can get for your cash, however, the Ryzen 7 7700 simply isn’t the right option: Look to the Core i5-13600K, or if your budget can stretch that far, possibly to the Core i7-13700K, which we plan to review in the coming weeks. ,AMD's Ryzen 7 7700 is a respectable processor with a worthy stock cooler and fast performance, especially in games, but it can't quite topple the Intel Core i5-13600K, which matches it in price.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Anker Soundcore Rave Party 2 Review,"A powerful portable stereo speaker,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,The Anker Soundcore Rave Party 2 speaker sets the stage for your next get-together with bright LED lights and a karaoke input, but it's not as durable as many competitors.,The Anker Soundcore Rave Party 2 , ($229) is larger and more expensive than its sibling, the , ($179.99), but that extra money gets you stereo audio and more party-friendly LED lights. It also includes a karaoke input with discrete gain and reverb controls. That said, the Rave Party 2 isn't fully waterproof, so it isn't as ideal for a pool party as the Rave Neo 2. Ultimately, the more affordable , ($179.99) remains our Editors' Choice winner in this segment because it produces similarly strong stereo sound from a much more weatherproof design.,The Soundcore Rave Party 2 measures 7.5 by 15.7 by 7.4 inches (HWD), weighs 11.1 pounds, and works in both horizontal and vertical orientations. In a horizontal configuration, the built-in handle resides on the right and the top is flat—too bad it doesn't house a wireless charging surface like the ,. Both the left and bottom panels have rubber feet that keep the unit stable on flat surfaces, no matter how you position it. ,Behind the front grille, dual 2-inch tweeters and dual 4-inch woofers combine for 120 watts of power. LEDs encircle the drivers and power the various lighting effects you can customize via the companion app. The speaker is compatible with Bluetooth 5.3, but Anker doesn't provide details on , support.,The control panel sits under the handle on the right side. It includes a power button (with accompanying battery status LEDs), a Bluetooth pairing button, and a Bass Up button (which is on by default). On the opposite side of the panel, you get a toggle for the LEDs, a PartyCast button for linking up to 100 compatible Soundcore speakers, volume controls, and a multifunction button that handles playback and track navigation depending on how many times you press it. ,A port on the back enables efficient driver movement and airflow. To the left of this, a circular cover protects the power connector (for the included charging cable), a USB-A port (for powering external devices), and a 3.5mm input. Anker doesn't include cables for the USB-A or aux connectors. Otherwise, this area has a quarter-inch microphone input, along with mic and reverb volume knobs. That's right—the speaker doubles as a portable karaoke machine, so long as you have a compatible mic.,The , is surprisingly low for a portable Bluetooth speaker of this size and price; it can handle only light splashes of water. Our favorite ,, including the aforementioned JBL Charge 5 and the , ($349.99), have much stronger IP67 ratings.,Anker estimates the speaker can last roughly 16 hours per charge, but your results will depend on how loud you keep the volume. ,You don't get a speakerphone here, but we don't necessarily expect that any longer. Many portable speakers are ditching that feature and most larger models never had it in the first place.,The Soundcore app (available for Android and iOS) is useful and easy to operate. Thankfully, it doesn't lock the ability to save , preferences behind an account here, unlike with the Rave Neo 2.,The main screen shows an image of the speaker, along with a battery life readout. Below this, you can select from several LED light show presets, with names such as Campfire Vibes and Spring Break. You can adjust the color schemes and rhythmic pattern of each preset or turn off these effects entirely. In testing, the LEDs sync moderately well to the music, particularly if there's a strong beat. ,If the LEDs aren't enough to entertain you, the app also includes some goofy extras in the Games section. You get a Spin the Bottle wheel, as well as a Light DJ section that offers turntable-like controls for the lights and a sound board for various effects. If you find joy in these extras, more power to you, but we're glad you can easily avoid them.,More important to the experience is an EQ section with nine adjustable faders and several presets. Otherwise, the app lets you set up the PartyCast feature, toggle the BassUp mode, install firmware updates, and adjust basic settings (such as the auto-power-off timing).,Generally speaking, the Rave Party 2 sounds better with the Bass Up mode active, so we left it on for our tests. On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” the speaker delivers powerful, palpable thump. The deep lows here are just at the edge of its range, but it still plays them with gusto. The output volume is impressively loud, and we didn't notice any distortion.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, better reveals the sound signature. The drums here aren't thunderous, but they still sound full and large. Callahan’s baritone vocals get the bulk of the low-frequency attention, but a treble edge provides necessary balance. The acoustic strums sound similarly bright. The drivers cast the mids slightly aside in favor of the deeper lows and sparkly highs, but it's a powerful presentation that should suit most party scenarios.,The speaker can't quite reproduce the sub-bass tones at the 34-second mark of Kendrick Lamar’s “Loyalty.” That’s not unusual because these are some seriously deep sub-bass elements and the systems capable of reproducing them typically cost a lot more. On this track, the drum loop and the highest ranges of the deeper synth notes receive the most bass attention. The various vocal performances sound crisp and clear, without much sibilance.,The lower-register instrumentation in orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, steps forward in the mix. The higher-register brass, strings, and vocals retain a bright presence, however, which steers things away from any muddiness. ,Overall, this sound signature isn't for purists who value accuracy. Then again, most portable speakers don't aim for that ideal. Booming, bass-forward audio is the norm and this Anker model fits that mold.,Although the Anker Soundcore Rave Party 2 can’t reproduce the super-deep bass tones of some tracks, it still delivers the powerful, sculpted sound signature that works well for parties. We’re also fans of the karaoke mic input and most aspects of the companion app. But a lackluster IPX4 rating means you have to be cautious of poolside splashes and inclement weather. The aforementioned JBL Charge 5 and Sony SRS-XG300 speakers are much more durable, so they remain our favorite outdoor-friendly models. If you seek substantially better sub-bass response, the more powerful , ($499.95) is another Editors’ Choice winner.,The Anker Soundcore Rave Party 2 speaker sets the stage for your next get-together with bright LED lights and a karaoke input, but it's not as durable as many competitors.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Anker Soundcore Rave Neo 2 Review,"Portable audio for your next pool party,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,The portable Anker Soundcore Rave Neo 2 speaker delivers palpable bass power and customizable LED lights in a waterproof design.,Anker's Soundcore Rave Neo 2 ($179.99) joins the larger , ($229) as the latest entries in the company's lineup of ,. This mono model pumps out impressive bass for its size and makes for a suitable poolside companion thanks to its waterproof build. We like that you can customize the onboard LEDs and tweak the sound signature via the companion app, though other aspects of the mobile experience feel very gimmicky. Overall, the smaller, more durable , ($179.99) remains our Editors' Choice winner in this price range because it outputs stereo sound, but it doesn't have the same fun lighting effects.,The Soundcore Rave Neo 2 measures roughly 11.2 by 7.0 by 6.1 inches (HWD). It sports rounded, black, semi-glossy plastic edges, a large metallic grille on the front, and lots of LEDs around its drivers. A built-in handle makes it easy to tote around, while a cover on the back protects USB-C (for the included USB-C charging cable), USB-A (for charging external devices), and 3.5mm aux inputs. We're disappointed the box doesn't include cables for the latter two ports because plenty of people still have devices and adapters that support one standard but not the other (and vice versa). ,Behind the grille, dual 2-inch tweeters and a 4-inch woofer deliver a combined 80 watts of power. The speaker is compatible with Bluetooth 5.3, but Anker doesn't provide any information about , support. Notably, if you have the funds and the ambition, you can pair up to 100 compatible Soundcore speakers simultaneously for more directional audio. ,Up top, there’s a silicone rubber panel with Bluetooth, bass, LED (to toggle the lights), power, pairing, and volume buttons. A central multifunction button between the volume controls handles playback and track navigation depending on how many times you tap it. ,An , means the speaker is fully waterproof. You can submerge it at depths of up to a meter for 30 minutes without an issue. Bluetooth signals don't work well underwater, but the point is that the device can handle poolside splashes, thunderstorms, and a rinse in the bathtub. The aforementioned JBL model has a slight edge here because its IP67 rating means it's protected from dust ingress as well. ,Anker estimates that the speaker can last roughly 18 hours per charge, but your real-world results will vary based on your typical listening volume.,Anker’s Soundcore app (available for Android and iOS) is equal parts useful and obnoxious, as it forces you to create an account in order to access all of its features. The main screen shows an image of the speaker with a battery life readout, along with playback and volume controls.,Further down, there are sections that let you customize the LED lights, use the , (which offers nine bands between 75Hz and 14KHz), set up the PlayCast feature (for linking additional speakers), and toggle the Bass Up setting (which is on by default). ,Swipe left from the main screen to access the Light DJ settings. Doing so launches a landscape view of two turntables; from here, you can manually control the lights and add in sound effects to your heart's content. Swipe right to bring up various party games that no one has ever needed an app for, like Spin the Bottle and Truth or Dare. The speaker's LEDs seamlessly sync with the spinning wheel on the app, but overall, these sections seem to be the vision of adults who were trying to guess what younger people would find cool.,Otherwise, the app lets you update the speaker's firmware, toggle prompt tones, and adjust the auto-power-off time. Unfortunately, and as mentioned, the app forces you to log in with an account before you can save certain settings like custom EQ presets. That's disappointing because the pricier Soundcore Rave Party 2 doesn't have the same limitation.,LEDs on portable speakers aren't novel at this point, but Anker at least has fun with it. For instance, the lights around the tweeters make them look like a pair of eyes on a cartoonish robot face. And when you adjust the volume, the LEDs that ring the woofer illuminate to show those levels.,In the app, you can choose between several lighting presets, such as Campfire Vibes, Euphoric Dance, Flow, Neon Night, Party, Romantic Stroll, or Spring Break. Most of these modes offer multiple color scheme options, too. Of course, if all of these lights ever become annoying, you can turn them off via the app.,We mostly left the Bass Up setting on for testing because that's the default. The speaker benefits from this mode, too—without it, the sound signature lacks a bit of low-end response. There's just one exception to that advice: Because the , (DSP) slightly thins out the deepest lows at top volumes, tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” sound slightly fuller without Bass Up mode. The good news is that we didn't hear any distortion at top volumes in either scenario.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the sound signature. With Bass Up mode active, the drums sound full and heavy—not quite thunderous, but certainly big. Callahan’s baritone vocals seem to grab the bulk of the low-frequency energy, but they also get some high-mid crispness that prevents muddiness. The acoustic strums sound bright, though a bit more buried in the mix than usual. ,The speaker struggles to reproduce the sub-bass tones at the 34-second mark of Kendrick Lamar’s “Loyalty.” The first of the deep bass notes is barely audible, while the rest of the progressively deeper sub-bass notes are absent. We don’t expect a speaker of this size to reproduce the lowest elements here, however. The various vocal performances come across with solid high-mid crispness, while the drum loop packs some extra thump.,Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, sound full because of the additional depth in the lower-register instrumentation. That said, the higher-register brass, strings, and vocals still sound clear.,The Anker Soundcore Rave Neo 2 outputs strong sound for a mono speaker of its size and is waterproof enough to survive rainstorms or splashes from your pool. It's frustrating that you have to sign up for an account to access all of the app’s features, but the customizable EQ makes it worth downloading. Ultimately, we're bigger fans of the aforementioned JBL Charge 5 in this price range because it produces stereo sound and is a bit more portable, but we understand if you prefer the Rave Neo 2 for its admittedly fun LEDs. If you want significantly more bass depth, meanwhile, you need to spend a lot more for a speaker like the , ($349.99), which also offers LED light capabilities.,The portable Anker Soundcore Rave Neo 2 speaker delivers palpable bass power and customizable LED lights in a waterproof design.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Monoprice 24-Inch CrystalPro Business Monitor Review,"An only-the-basics monitor for office penny-pinchers,Since 2004, I have worked on PCMag’s hardware team, covering at various times printers, scanners, projectors, storage, and monitors. I currently focus my testing efforts on 3D printers, pro and productivity displays, and drives and SSDs of all sorts. ,The Monoprice CrystalPro Business Monitor is a bare-bones 24-inch display that should satisfy shoppers on a tight budget.,You don't set your expectations super-high for a , priced at $149.99, and the Monoprice 24-Inch CrystalPro Business Monitor doesn't surpass those expectations. As a budget display for office or home use, it has a modest feature set and performance typical of under-$200 monitors in its size class. The CrystalPro doesn't really give you any cause for complaint, but there's no question that its main draw is its price. Cash-strapped folks may want to take a gander at the CrystalPro if they can find it for $135 or less, though for a little more money the like-sized , has more robust SRGB color coverage, adds an extra (DisplayPort) input, and has a stand with a full range of ergonomic features.,The 23.8-inch CrystalPro is an in-plane switching (IPS) panel with full HD (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) native resolution and a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, all standard fare for low-priced monitors. It's rated for a 1,000:1 contrast ratio and a peak brightness of 250 nits (candelas per square meter). Its 1080p 24-inch panel has a respectable pixel density of 92 pixels per inch (ppi), which is fine for everyday use, as long as you're not a photo enthusiast looking to do pixel-precise image editing. Typical of an IPS display, the Monoprice has wide viewing angles (rated at 178 degrees vertical and horizontal), ensuring consistent colors even if your viewing posture isn't straight-on.,The CrystalPro's refresh rate is 75Hz, which should make for slightly smoother video viewing than you'll get at the usual 60Hz. But without support for adaptive sync technologies such as Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync (which fight image tearing, stuttering, and judder), the advantage of the higher refresh rate for gaming is minimal.,The all-black monitor measures 16.4 by 21.3 by 8.2 inches including its stand. It has a nearly bezel-less frame; the bottom bezel is about a quarter-inch thick, while the side and top bezels are vanishingly thin.,The stand is short on ergonomic features, being limited to just tilt adjustment—also typical of economy displays. (Some budget models up the ergonomic ante, such as the Editors' Choice-award-winning HP 24mh with its tilt, height, and pivot adjustment.) Fortunately, the CrystalPro is small and light enough that you can easily move it or turn it around to change your viewing angle or access the ports. It can be wall- or arm-mounted with the addition of a VESA bracket, though it has only two mounting holes spaced 75mm apart instead of the typical four-hole square configuration; I wasn't able to test it with a VESA mount so I can't speak to its stability.,Like most budget monitors, the CrystalPro has a limited selection of ports: in this case, one HDMI and one VGA, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack and an audio-in jack. The ports are in back facing outward, which is preferable to the more common, less accessible downward-facing arrangement we see in too many monitors (inexpensive and expensive alike).,You navigate the Monoprice monitor's onscreen display (OSD) menus with five buttons on the bottom right edge. This isn't as easy to use as the mini joystick controllers finding their way onto some budget monitors.,Monoprice covers the 24-inch CrystalPro with a one-year warranty. That's far from unusual for an under-$200 display, but it's at the low end for monitor coverage.,I did our color and brightness testing using a , and , software. As mentioned, Monoprice rates the CrystalPro 24's , at 250 nits; it came up slightly shy of that at 233 nits in my testing, which is still adequate for everyday business use. Similarly, I measured the monitor's contrast ratio at 942:1, a smidge south of its advertised 1,000:1 but still respectable.,The CrystalPro offers fair color coverage for a budget display, covering 94.4% of the sRGB gamut in my testing (see the chromaticity chart above). We generally look for at least 95% sRGB coverage from a desktop monitor, even with economy models, but this was close enough considering that colors looked fine in my ad-hoc testing (viewing film clips and photos powered by the integrated graphics from , and , laptops).,Videos looked reasonably bright, with natural-looking colors, and the CrystalPro showed decent contrast in both light and dark areas. Photos also looked fairly bright, with good color. We don't expect low-cost business monitors to excel in the Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color spaces (used for prepress photos and digital video, respectively), but for the record, the Monoprice turned in 73.1% Adobe RGB and 75.5% DCI-P3 coverage.,Monoprice has built a name for itself by selling solid if basic products at cut-rate prices, and the 24-inch CrystalPro monitor fits that mold. You won't be wowed by its features, but its image quality is more than adequate for office work and light entertainment, and its price undercuts some of our favorite affordable 24-inch displays.,The CrystalPro shares a 75Hz refresh rate and slim-bezel design with the Editors' Choice-award-winning ,, though it lacks the LG's dual HDMI ports and mini joystick controller. That said, the LG model retails for around $200, while the Monoprice sells for considerably less. Another Editors' Choice-winning pick, the HP 24mh, sells for about $150; it adds a DisplayPort connector and has near-perfect (99.5%) sRGB color coverage and a higher-than-rated contrast ratio. Give that HP strong preference if the pricing is close and you can choose between the two. ,Still, although it is not one of our top picks, the 24-inch CrystalPro looks good and costs little. If you're a frugal shopper, that could make all the difference.,The Monoprice CrystalPro Business Monitor is a bare-bones 24-inch display that should satisfy shoppers on a tight budget.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Tamron 20-40mm F2.8 Di III VXD Review,"An extra-wide zoom sized for gimbals,Images, and the devices that capture them, are my focus. I've covered cameras at PCMag for the past 10 years, which has given me a front row seat for the DSLR to mirrorless transition, the smartphone camera revolution, and the mainstream adoption of drones for aerial imaging. You can find me on Instagram ,.,The Tamron 20-40mm F2.8 Di III VXD lens pairs well with gimbals for the vlogging crowd, and features an extra-wide view that photographers can appreciate too.,Most lenses are easy enough to categorize, but the Tamron 20-40mm F2.8 Di III VXD ($699) isn't like most lenses. It lives somewhere between a wide and standard zoom, and for some creators, it could be a go-to lens in spite of its short range. Vloggers will look to it as a gimbal-friendly zoom to self-record social media video, while photo-minded creators are sure to see the appeal of a small, wide zoom for travel and handheld work. It's not as much of a crowd-pleaser as a traditional standard zoom, like the compact and value-minded ,, but wide-angle fans will find plenty to like.,We're used to seeing ultra-wide zooms that start at 16mm and standard options with a 24mm starting point. This 20-40mm starts right in the middle, with an angle of view that's perfect for present-to-camera handheld vlogging, cityscapes, and environmental portraiture, but falls short of the background-blurring power common to telephotos that cross the 70mm line.,Size is a feature here, though, and limiting the coverage range goes a long way toward keeping the 20-40mm small. At around 3.4 by 2.9 inches (HD) and 12.9 ounces, it's in line with some primes, including the , (3.6 by 2.9 inches, 15.7 ounces).,There is a change in length when zooming, as the optical block moves back and forth by a couple of centimeters to set the zoom. Even so, it doesn't throw the balance off enough to matter with gimbals, at least not ones like the ,. If you have the means, however, the Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G is a more attractive option for video specialists thanks to its internal electronically controlled zoom and wider angle of view, though it's also more costly at around $1,200.,Although it's a value option, Tamron still puts dust, splash, and anti-smudge fluorine protection into the lens. The barrel is a plastic composite, but a sturdy one. Dust and splash protection is extended to the onboard USB-C connector, too, which is used to plug the lens into a PC for firmware updates and to fine-tune manual focus response. The ,, a free download for Android, Mac, and Windows, is required.,As far as modern lenses go, the Tamron 20-40mm offers up the bare minimum for on-barrel controls. It includes rubberized zoom and manual focus rings, but that's it. Creators looking for an aperture control ring, focus toggle switch, or function button are in for some disappointment; those are all included on the Sony FE PZ 16-35mm.,But even without them, the 20-40mm handles like any other basic lens. The mechanical zoom action is easy to adjust, and the barrel has marks to indicate 20, 24, 28, 35, and 40mm focal lengths.,The manual focus ring is located toward the front of the lens. It turns comfortably, with just a little bit of drag. The resistance is welcome because the manual focus response is a bit sensitive, at least by default. Out of the box, the 20-40mm is set to a nonlinear focus response, and it's a bit touchy. The Lens Utility app lets you change the response to linear, with an adjustable rotation angle. I found that 180 degrees offered the precision I was after for fine manual focus adjustment.,Autofocus is speedy, and quiet enough to use for video. I recorded some vlog-style clips with the lens and a7R V and the 20-40mm did its job keeping focus locked on my face, even as I moved the lens closer and further away, albeit with a little bit of hesitation. The lens shows some focus breathing, but the effect is only really noticeable in video shots that rack from a close to a far subject.,Close focus is available to 6.7 inches at 20mm for 1:3.8 macro reproduction. When zoomed in, the close-up focus slips to 11.4 inches, for lesser 1:5.1 results. No one will accuse this lens of being a go-to for macros, but it's capable of getting close in order to accentuate its background-blurring effects.,Optical stabilization is left out, but it's less of a concern for Sony cameras, as all but the first generation of full-frame models include five-axis sensor stabilization. I paired the 20-40mm with the , for handheld long exposure shots and managed good results at shutter speeds as lengthy as 1/2-second.,I matched the 20-40mm with the 60MP Sony , for our Imatest lab testing. Lab tests show the zoom to be an outstanding performer in the center at 20mm at f/2.8, but with soft results when looking toward the edges and corners. Picture quality picks up across the frame at f/4, but you'll want to use f/5.6-8 for the clearest results from center to edge, in the excellent range for the a7R IV (4,600-4,900 lines).,Test chart scores are just about the same at 30mm and 40mm. This is a lens that you'll want to use wide open for dim light or to accentuate background blur, but set to a narrower f-stop for scenes where you want sharp focus across the frame. Images made out in the real world matched up with lab results.,As with any lens, there's some loss of contrast when using very small apertures. Even so, there's reason to set the lens from f/16-22. The lens renders multi-point sunstars at these settings, an effect that some landscape specialists chase.,You won't get bokeh with every image with this lens, but a soft, defocused background is achievable when the lens is fairly close to the subject. The lens doesn't offer up the smoothest backgrounds, however, as hard-edge highlights can lend to a busy look, exacerbated by an onion skin texture visible in specular highlights.,Optical corrections are required to get the most out of the 20-40mm, but they work well and are transparent for many creators. If you're recording video or snapping JPG stills, the camera's processing engine removes the somewhat modest barrel and pincushion distortion that's visible in unedited Raw format images. Adobe includes a correction profile for the lens for , editors; we tested the profile and it did an appropriate job straightening lines in architectural studies and removing a vignette cast at f/2.8.,Tamron has done a good job filling in some value-minded gaps in the Sony lens system. It was first to market with the low-cost , and already has a , zoom in its catalog. The 20-40mm F2.8 Di III VXD sits in between those options in angle of view, and makes the tiny lens an intriguing proposition for creators who don't use the long end of a standard zoom too often, as well as for vloggers after a gimbal-friendly zoom.,At around $699, the 20-40mm F2.8 is positioned as an affordable alternative to Sony's lineup. It drops on-barrel controls to meet that price, but it doesn't cut corners when it comes to weather protection or autofocus speed. It's a much more video- and action-friendly lens than a slower-focusing budget option, like the ,.,If you're looking for a more capable zoom, you can get there by spending more money. Vloggers should take a look at the $1,200 Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4; its wider angle of coverage and power zoom are appealing for video. And hybrid creators may want to think about the , ($1,099), a just-announced zoom that's going on sale this spring.,Neither of the name-brand options fall under the value umbrella, however, leaving the 20-40mm as a solidly good zoom, at least for creators who are happy with its range of coverage. If you're looking for a more traditional zoom and don't want to spend too much, the , and the , are both excellent performers.,The Tamron 20-40mm F2.8 Di III VXD lens pairs well with gimbals for the vlogging crowd, and features an extra-wide view that photographers can appreciate too.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Need For Speed Unbound Review,"I've got a need...for better car handling,I’m a Junior Analyst and ISF-certified TV calibrator focused on reviewing computer accessories, laptops, gaming monitors, and video games. I’ve been writing, playing, and complaining about games for as long as I remember, but it wasn’t until recently that I’ve been able to shout my opinions directly at a larger audience. My work has appeared on iMore, Windows Central, Android Central, and TWICE, and I have a diverse portfolio of editing work under my belt from my time spent at Scholastic and Oxford University Press. I also have a few book-author credits under my belt—I’ve contributed to the sci-fi anthology , and I’ve even written a Peppa Pig book.,Need for Speed Unbound is a beautiful street racing game that features a cool soundtrack and welcome cross-platform play, but frustrating car physics and CPU drivers sully the experience.,2022 was a stacked year that featured indie darlings (Immortality), blockbusters (,), and smaller, surprise hits (,), so it shouldn't be a shock that a game or two slipped under your radar. But the biggest blink-and-you-miss-it release might be late November's Need for Speed Unbound, the latest entry in EA’s long-running street racing series. With Criterion Games (of Burnout fame) at the helm, Unbound had the potential to be one of the best racing games of the year—or a return to series form after a few missteps. But while aesthetically pleasing and featuring cross-platform play with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, the $69.99 , lacks satisfactory car handling and a thriving, in-game world.,Need for Speed Unbound is as loud and braggadocious as previous series entries, but its new art style gives the game a unique flourish. The character models feature a cel-shaded, ,-esque look, while the realistic cars are adorned with eye-catching effects during big drifts and air time. The game looks great, both standing still and in motion, though I couldn't help but wish that the flashy visuals found their way into the rest of the game, if only to help it stand out from the , pack.,You're set loose in Lakeshore City, a fictionalized Chicago where you're free to casually drive around, accept challenges, and stop at meet-ups to race for cash. Think ,, but with far fewer crashes. You operate on a day-and-night cycle that changes every time you enter a hideout. The city itself is somewhat empty though. Pedestrians and cars line the streets and sidewalks, but they do little to make the city feel alive.,Need for Speed Unbound has a story mode that gives you a reason for racing. You and your friend, Yaz, work at an old mechanic shop owned by former street racer Rydell. After a dispute with Rydell, Yaz double-crosses the mechanic and steals the high-profile cars that Rydell was working on. Two years later, you find yourself back in the underground racing scene to compete in The Grand, a race run by your former friend, Yaz. Most of the story happens over phone calls while driving, so it's never too long before you’re out racing again. Although the dialogue is delivered well, it’s full of Gen-Z, too-cool-for-school sound bites.,Racing isn’t as simple as just showing up at a designated location, though that's how you initiate the contests. Need for Speed Unbound has free races, but the stakes are raised once you race for in-game cash. You can make progress if you don’t score first place, but you’ll want to make a decent rank if only to break even. Of course, street racing isn’t complete with a good police chase.,Police chases have a Heat meter rank; the higher the Heat, the more aggressive the police. You gain Heat by racing multiple times in one night, while evading Five-O (or in some cases, ramming through them). Heat is reset every time you bank your cash at one of your hideouts. The cop chases are thrilling, but the racing itself isn’t that fun.,I’ve spent many hours playing arcade racers like Crusin’ Blast and super-realistic racers like Gran Turismo 7, so I’ve dabbled in the racing genre's respective deep ends. However, I could not find the right balance in Need for Speed Unbound. The car’s physics felt off, and I grew frustrated during the game's early hours. Even after some time and upgrades, nothing felt like it was genuinely improving my car. Races are a chore, especially when you factor in the overly aggressive driver AI that easily took the lead from me because of a bad drift.,At least the music helps with some of the tedium, with a diverse , that features indie pop and trap songs from artists like A$AP Rocky, Charli XCX, Diplo, and PlayBoy Carti. They blend well with the game's aesthetic and add a charm that had me nostalgic for EA Sports BIG, Electronic Arts' arcade-style extreme sports label that ceased operations back in 2008.,But while the soundtrack and visuals won me over in the opening hours of the game, the frustration started to settle in. The animated flourishes are nice, but they clash with the realistic cityscape in a way that bothered me. On top of that, visceral car crashes don't cause much visible damage. Please EA, the children yearn for Burnout’s over-the-top stunt crashing.,In a nice touch, Need for Speed Unbound has PC/PlayStation/Xbox crossplay that focuses on racing and upgrading your car. However, it lacks a few features; you can only engage in cop chases. In addition, online and local progression are treated as two separate affairs. That's hard to stomach considering the cost of the extensive customization options (there are more than 10,000 options, including rims and wraps). At least you use in-game cash, not real-world money. ,To get Need for Speed Unbound up and running on your gaming rig, EA recommends a PC housing at least an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 or Intel Core i5-8660 ,, AMD Radeon RX570 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti ,, 8GB of RAM, 50GB of HDD space, and the Windows 10 operating system. The recommended settings are higher, as you'll need at least an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or Intel i7-8700 CPU, AMD RX5700 or Nvidia GeForce 2070 GPU, and 16GB of RAM.,My testbed, which contains an Intel Core i7-10700K CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, pushed the game at a smooth 60 frames per second at 1440p resolution, both in and out of races. The game looks great, too. Raindrops realistically plop against droptops, and the colorful effects pop against the realistic backdrops. The game isn’t too varied in its environmental offerings, but it’s not drab, either. Car destruction was kept to a minimum, unfortunately.,Need for Speed Unbound supports ,, steering wheels, Steam Achievements, and Steam Cloud. There isn’t official , support (perhaps due to the game requiring Origin credentials), but there is a workaround if you insist on playing it on the go.,At the end of the day, it's good to see a new Need for Speed. Unbound feels like a bit of a time capsule, reminiscent of classic games in the NFS catalog, as well as retro games with similar aesthetics. Still, it misses the exit when it comes to its actual driving, and many of its other contenders, be it sim or arcade racing, leave it in the dust. It’s not by any stretch a bad game, and given the genre's slim pickings, it’s a notable title. It’s just one that you might want to wait out for a price cut.

Fire Emblem Engage Review,"A classic strategy-RPG with new touches,I’ve been PCMag’s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).,Fire Emblem Engage recalls earlier series entries by hitting familiar tactical notes, but it augments them with a cool, new team-up system. Its multiplayer modes need work, though.,The Fire Emblem series seemed to take an enticing step forward with Fire Emblem: Three Houses on the ,. It took the franchise's classic, strategy-RPG formula and built its fairly simple character support system into a more Persona-like balancing act of time, resources, and relationships. It also offered a branching story that gave the game replayability without retreading the awkward, multi-release debacle that was Fire Emblem Fates on the 3DS. It was excellent, and well-received enough to justify its own ,. It represented a potential Fire Emblem evolution. ,The newest series chapter, Fire Emblem Engage ($59.99), is a step back from that ambition and settles into a much more stock Fire Emblem experience. The , and , elements that have been present since Fire Emblem’s beginnings on the Famicom are here, as well as a new feature that lets you equip (not recruit) famous series characters to your team. Unfortunately, this , lacks Three Houses' impact. It also makes some puzzling missteps with multiplayer modes. Still, Fire Emblem Engage is a strong single-player SRPG, despite Three Houses feeling like a more contemporary game.,Engage takes place in the world of Elyos, where you play the holy dragon Alear. You wake up with no memory after sleeping for 1,000 years and find that the evil Fell Dragon has returned, coincidentally, after roughly the same amount of time. He was sealed away by the 12 Emblem rings that each contain the spirits of warriors from other worlds (the protagonists of other Fire Emblem games), so you must explore the continent and recruiting forces to recover those rings.,Engage lacks Fire Emblem: Three Houses' political intrigue or Fire Emblem Fates' deeper personal conflicts, calling back to older Fire Emblem games and their more direct stories. It’s reminiscent of Fire Emblem Awakening, the Nintendo 3DS game that arguably kicked off the series’ popularity in the west. You can expect a few twists and turns, but not much more than your average action-focused anime.,Social interactions have been scaled back to more traditional Fire Emblem levels, as well. You won’t find Three Houses’ careful, ,-like game of balancing time and resources outside of battles. When characters fight next to each other (or Alear gives them gifts), they bond and trigger short, usually amusing cutscenes that raise their companionship levels and make them more effective when battling together.,The series' core is turn-based, tactical combat, and Engage delivers that just as capably as any Fire Emblem. Battles are fought from a top-down, grid-based perspective, with one side getting a chance to move all of its units before the other side makes its commands. ,Each unit has its own class, weapons, and stats, and they factor into how effective the squads are against different opponents. The usual rock-paper-scissors-like match-ups of weapons and skills are here, too: swords beat axes, axes beat lances, lances beat swords, magic beats armor, archers beat flying units, and so on. You can upgrade your units to advanced versions of their classes, or switch them between different classes with rare, special items (they become easier to acquire as you progress). Some characters even have their own unique, specialized classes.,Victory comes when you defeat the enemy’s commander, eliminate all enemy units, or occasionally navigate a specific unit to an objective. Of course, you lose when all of your forces are beaten, but the stakes can be as low or as high as you’d like thanks to a now-standard Fire Emblem gameplay option. Playing in Casual mode means your units are available after a battle even if they’re struck down, while Classic mode means any unit lost in any battle is permanently gone (a Fire Emblem tradition). To make the game even more forgiving, Alear has a time crystal that lets you roll back each turn. If you make a mistake, you can go back and make another decision. Both the time crystal and Casual mode remove the frustration that comes with repeating a battle every time a unit you like gets killed, but it tips the game balance toward the easy side of the spectrum.,To distinguish itself from other Fire Emblem games, Engage has the Engage system. Each of the 12 rings has its own Emblem, the aforementioned warrior spirit of a previous Fire Emblem protagonist. Any of your characters can equip these rings, letting them Engage to temporarily team up with their respective Emblem and unlock powerful new skills. For example, a pair of warriors can run arrows on enemies from far away or use special weapons specific to that Emblem after a successful Engage. The power up only lasts a few turns, and you can only use that Emblem’s special skill once during that time. As a result, Engage feels more like a bonus ability rather than a significant combat element. Still, Engage adds new, if temporary, options and benefits to your favorite units.,By spending Bond Points, you can also make each Emblem ring generate its own sub-rings based on other characters in that Emblem's respective Fire Emblem game. These rings offer minor stat boosts to your other units, but not unique, tactical aspects. This is more of a collectible feature to entice and frustrate completionists more than anything else; each character's ring has a grade from C to S that indicates how much of a boost it gives. The boosts are randomly generated, so they feel almost like a mobile game lottery feature (though thankfully without ,). This inspiration makes sense considering Fire Emblem Heroes is one of Nintendo's most successful mobile releases.,Engage's main campaign has more than two dozen chapters, each of which has its own map with a mission. There are also more than half as many Paralogue missions, separate maps that lets you unlock new characters or find hidden potential in your Emblems. If you find your characters underpowered, skirmishes appear all over the world map that let you fight in areas you’ve already beaten, with a basic defeat-all-the-enemies goal. Use them to grind your units’ compatibility levels as much as you want.,Despite the relatively lengthy campaign, Engage feels smaller than Fire Emblem: Three Houses. The downtime between battles is much more optional and less strategic than carefully planning your time in the previous game. In addition, Engage lacks branching paths to incentivize playing the campaign over again.,There are also short challenge campaigns called Tempest Trials that can be found in the Tower of Trials at your home base. They’re three-map sets of battles with difficulty you can tweak to best fit your forces’ abilities. They don’t provide experience or gold; instead, they give you ability gems to upgrade your Emblems’ special weapons. However, the amount of gems needed to power up even one weapon requires grinding the trials several times. The battles themselves tend to be much more difficult, and tedious, due to the sheer number of enemy units compared with the rest of the game.,Gold can be annoyingly hard to come by since only a single, relatively rare type of skirmish mission rewards gold when you beat it (and only a few enemy units at most will give you gold each map). You use gold to buy new equipment, upgrade the equipment you currently have, keep your units stocked with different consumable items, and acquire the special items you need to upgrade classes. You also use gold to upgrade different regions you explore so they provide better rewards after skirmishes. That process has the steepest prices of all; you’ll be lucky to get 3,000 gold out of a given battle, and upgrading a region from level 3 to level 4 costs 50,000. The scant gold means you can’t shower your units with equipment and upgrades.,The Tower of Trials also lets you use the game’s two online , modes: Relay Trials and Outland Trials. Relay Trials let you cooperatively fight a battle with others, though not at the same time. Each player takes turns, working their way through the fight one after the other, and everyone who participates gets a reward when the mission is complete. It’s certainly a unique idea, but it feels like an even slower spin on playing a single turn before passing your Switch to a friend for them to take a turn. There’s little indication of when a friend, or random player online, will actually take the next turn.,The other multiplayer mode, Outland Trials, is a bit more fleshed-out, but still underwhelming. It Outland Trials let you fight other players’ armies one of two ways. You can simply match up with another player and fight them on a map, or you can make a custom map of your own and then link it with another player’s custom map for a more varied experience. ,That would be a great idea, except for three problems. First, you can’t directly fight your opponent; both modes involve fighting the computer-controlled forces of other players instead. There’s no real head-to-head strategy where you face another player’s wits, as well as their team. It’s strange, because Relay Trials prove that a turn-based, chess-by-mail mode is possible.,Second, the maps are minuscule. Quick matches take place on 14-by-14-square maps barely larger than a chessboard, and even custom maps are limited to a 22-by-10-square space for your side. There’s no option to put together an entire challenge map for other players, only mashing together these small half-maps or playing on an even tinier random one.,Third, you can only upload one custom map at a time. I don’t even understand that one.,There are compelling components of a multiplayer suite here, but they’re haphazardly scattered across a few modes that don’t feel complete. An online, turn-by-turn competitive mode is sorely needed, as is an expanded map editor that lets you challenge other players with custom missions.,Fire Emblem Engage looks and runs fine. As a turn-based strategy-RPG with a primary view that takes place from above the map, most graphical details are seen in the short battle scenes and cinematic cut scenes. It’s colorful in a fairly generic , style that fits the series’ roots, but doesn’t have much identity besides Alear’s wild, red-and-blue, two-tone hair and heterochromia. I noticed no performance issues, but they’re harder to pick out in a turn-based game than in an action game where every frame counts.,Fire Emblem Engage is an enjoyable strategy-RPG and it can be seen as a series celebration through its use of the literal spirits of previous games’ protagonists. It doesn’t feel quite as deep or fresh as Three Houses, though, and ultimately just gives the impression of being “yet another Fire Emblem game.” Its multiplayer modes are half-baked affairs, too. Still, Engage has an excellent single-player campaign that's worth a play if you're a genre or series fan.,For more recommended Nintendo Switch titles, check out , and ,.

Bose Smart Soundbar 600 Review,"Spatial audio in a small package with bright sound,I’ve been PCMag’s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).,The Bose Smart Soundbar 600 is a small and feature-packed speaker that features upward-firing drivers for height-based spatial audio, but its highs can be cutting and its bass response is often too thin.,The Bose Smart Soundbar 600 ($499) packs impressive technology into a compact design. Notably, it adds height channels to the standard left-center-right driver arrangement, creating a large sound field with excellent spatial audio imaging. It also features Amazon's Alexa voice assistant and Apple AirPlay 2 and Google Cast. Without a subwoofer, however, the ,'s audio balance is skewed toward the high-mids and highs. This makes dialogue easy to understand at the expense of bass response. While the , ($449) also doesn't have powerful bass and lacks height channels, it has many of the same features, costs less, and offers a more balanced sound signature.,The Smart Soundbar 600 is fairly small, measuring 2.2 by 27.3 by 4.1 inches (HWD) and weighing 6.9 pounds. Those are approximately the same dimensions as the Sonos Beam (2.7 by 25.7 by 4.0 inches). It’s short enough that you should easily be able to fit it comfortably in front of all but the lowest-sitting TVs.,The soundbar is a simple black rectangle with slightly curved corners. A metal grille wraps around the front and sides, and a second, smaller grille is built into the top panel for the upward-firing drivers. A silver Bose logo sits centered on the front, and indicator LEDs glow in the upper left corner when the mic is muted or Alexa is listening. Two touch-sensitive buttons, one for the microphone and one to activate Alexa, reside on the top panel to the left of the grille. There are no volume controls on the soundbar itself.,The back of the soundbar features two bass ports closer to the sides and a recessed cavity with physical connections in the center. Wired options are simple and include an HDMI port for eARC, an optical port for Toslink, 3.5mm ports for an optional subwoofer and IR blaster, a micro USB port for service, and a port for the power cable.,The included remote is a small black card measuring 4.1 by 1.6 by 0.5 inches. A rubberized top panel includes indentations for the different controls. The remote has Power, Input, Bluetooth, Music Mode, Mute, and Play/Pause buttons, along with a volume rocker. The remote is helpful if you don’t want to use the Bose Music app to control the soundbar, but you’ll more likely use your TV’s volume controls.,Despite its small size, the Smart Soundbar 600 supports Dolby Atmos. The soundbar includes a single forward-firing tweeter for center channel audio and dialogue, while the left and right drivers are aimed out the sides, and the two height drivers point straight up through the grille on the top panel.,The Smart Soundbar 600 is primarily designed to be used with a TV through an eARC connection, but it also supports optical audio. For wireless connectivity, it has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and works with ,, Google Cast, and ,. It can also be used as a smart speaker. , is built-in natively, while , is supported only if paired with a separate Google Assistant-equipped device, such as the ,.,To set up and control the soundbar beyond its few remote-based functions, you must use the Bose Music app (available for Android and iOS). It’s a fairly simple app that lets you group multiple Bose speakers together, switch sources, and tweak the audio. The ability to adjust the sound is minimal. It includes a toggle for Dialogue Mode, a Wall EQ preset for when the soundbar is mounted on a wall, a few timing and delay settings for matching the soundbar with the TV picture, and simple ,s for bass and treble, and balancing the center and the height channels.,You can’t expect powerful bass out of any compact soundbar, and that’s the case with the Smart Soundbar 600. It can fill a room with a large sound field of low-mids to highs, but it struggles with deep lows. The kick drum hits and bass synth notes in our bass test track, The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” come through with little force at higher volumes, and the drums distort significantly when the volume reaches 75%. Some digital signal processing comes into play to tamp down those frequencies at high volumes; the track actually sounds fuller and deeper at about half-volume.,The weak bass is noticeable even on tracks with less sub-bass content, like Yes’ “Roundabout.” The opening acoustic guitar plucks enjoy plenty of high-frequency presence, which provides a strong sense of string texture, but also sounds a bit harsh without strong low-mid resonance to balance it out. When the track properly kicks in, the bassline pops and sounds distant while the higher frequencies of the guitars and vocals punch through the mix. It’s a brittle sound. Boosting the bass through the Bose Music app doesn’t seem to help much. Adding a subwoofer might balance the soundbar’s audio some, but at greater expense.,While its balance doesn’t serve music very well without a subwoofer, the Smart Soundbar 600 is quite capable with TV and movies. Films with spatial audio benefit from the upward-firing drivers, though the room-filling sound doesn’t offer any rear surround imaging. (You can always add rear surround satellites to the mix, such as the $399 Bose Surround Speakers). The , audio of , produces a large sound field with a strong sense of height. The chase in the opening scene audibly kicks rubble over as well as around the listener. Lows and low-mids are weak, however, making the action a bit more crunchy than booming. Despite the lacking bass, the soundbar produces a wide, fairly accurate audio image considering its small size.,The 5.1-channel soundtrack of , comes across as large and textured, with the environmental sounds like water fountains filtering through with presence that convincingly fills in the aural space. Dialogue is crystal clear and distinct; the Smart Soundbar 600’s focus on highs and high-mids really brings out speech. At around 50% volume, the bass tones of the film come through with at least some body and produce a sound that's somewhat more balanced in effect than what you hear with music alone.,The Bose Smart Soundbar 600 is a technically impressive soundbar considering the large audio field it can generate. The wide-firing mains and upward-firing height channels help create a wide sonic signature that impresses more so with movies than music. Without a separate subwoofer, though, its bass performance is sadly weak, and as a single-piece home theater solution, its sharp performance makes it fall a bit flat. For a little less money, the Sonos Beam fares a bit better with low frequencies. The , ($179.99), which lacks Dolby Atmos and voice controls, provides a louder, more balanced sound and can be paired with its own subwoofer for less than the price of the Bose or Sonos soundbars. ,The Bose Smart Soundbar 600 is a small and feature-packed speaker that features upward-firing drivers for height-based spatial audio, but its highs can be cutting and its bass response is often too thin.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Logitech G Astro Gaming A30 Review,"Flexible connectivity, but a bit pricey for the performance,I’ve been PCMag’s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).,The Logitech G Astro Gaming A30 tries to hit a pleasant middle ground among wireless gaming headsets, but it's too expensive for its sound and build quality.,Astro Gaming has been one of the big names in high-end , for years, long before Logitech purchased the company. The brand has a strong legacy, but it lags behind the competition in terms of value, features, and ergonomics. The Logitech G Astro A30 wireless gaming headset is the first Astro-made headset to feature Bluetooth, and it has an attractive look that's a step forward from Astro’s older, stiffer headsets. At $229.99, it sits between the , ($119.99) and the , ($299.99) wireless headsets as a middle-ground option, but even that price feels inflated in the face of its muted bass response and less-than-luxurious build. You can find similar, or even slightly better, performance outside of Astro’s offerings with our Editors’ Choice winner, the , ($99.99). And if you want to splurge, the , ($349.99) is our top high-end pick for its fantastic build, feel, and features. ,The A30 has Astro’s signature rectangular earcup shape, with a solid, matte plastic build. The headset is available in black with red fabric on the earcups' interior, or in white with purple fabric. Both versions have identical translucent back panels bearing the Astro and A30 logos that are magnetically attached to cover a glossy, iridescent finish.,Although rectangular, the earpads are large enough to comfortably sit on your ears and they're made of soft memory foam covered with supple faux leather. The headband's underside is less generously padded and wrapped in rubber. It’s a comfortable fit that breathes relatively well, but it puts more pressure on your scalp than a more padded headband or ski-goggle-style suspension headband.,The left earcup holds a mic mute switch, a 2.5mm connector for the detachable boom mic, and a 3.5mm audio port along the bottom edge. The right earcup has a USB-C port for charging on the bottom edge, with a four-directional control switch, a Bluetooth button, and a power button running up the back edge. ,The control switch is unique for a gaming headset. Tilting it up or down adjusts the volume, tilting it forward or back adjusts the game/chat mix, and pressing it in plays/pauses music (with double and triple presses skipping tracks forward or backward). It’s a clever control method that takes up less space than two dials, but it’s so small and flat that it can be hard to feel and accurately manipulate with a large thumb.,The included USB transmitter is a basic, rectangular dongle with a USB-A plug on one end. Astro also makes an optional $34.99 USB-C transmitter for using the headset with a , or a USB-C-equipped phone with better fidelity than Bluetooth (or if you’re a , user who simply wants to use the USB-C port on the front to free up the USB-A port).,Besides the USB transmitter and detachable boom mic, the A30 comes with a USB-C-to-USB-A cable for charging, a 3.5mm cable for using the headset wired, and a hard-shell zip-up carrying case that holds everything.,With Astro under Logitech’s umbrella, the A30 headset doesn't use the increasingly outdated Astro Command Software for PC and Mac. Instead, you must use the Logitech G app for , and , to access a five-band equalizer with curiously only two presets (Immersive and Footsteps, neither of which display what the EQ curve looks like). The app also offers settings for the detachable boom mic and the internal mic (used for calls when connected over Bluetooth), with four noise gate settings and a sidetone slider. That's a pretty slim selection, but it’s not too different from what the Astro Command Center software offered.,The A30 has multiple versions designed to work with PCs, PlayStations (4/5), and Xboxes (One/Series X/S) via the USB transmitter, as well as with mobile devices via Bluetooth. If you want to switch between PC and PS5, you must keep your phone ready to make some simple tweaks. The headset has two wireless connection modes, and using it with a PS5 while in PC mode makes everything sound far too quiet., isn’t built into the A30, either through the USB transmitter or app. This means you must rely on your connected device's simulated surround features. If you own a PS5, don't fret; the audio tech is built into the system. On PC, you can use Windows Sonic for Headphones or purchase a license for Dolby Atmos for Headphones, DTS:X for Headphones, or Razer THX Spatial Audio. Again, this is the sort of omission we’ve seen on past Astro headsets, so it’s little surprise that a spatial audio feature isn’t included here.,The A30’s boom microphone is suitable for calls and voice chat, but not much more. It sounds slightly fuzzy and can be overly sensitive to plosives; it lacks the clear edge needed for recording or ,. Of course, we recommend buying a dedicated , if you’re a serious content creator, but otherwise, Razer’s Barracuda X has a much clearer boom. The A30 also has a smaller pinhole mic for taking calls without the boom attached. Although it sounds fuzzier and more distant than the boom mic, it works well enough for voice communication.,Don’t crank the volume to maximum if you want powerful bass. At about 70% volume, the kick drum hits and bass synth notes sound full and robust, reaching well into the lower frequencies, though still not hitting subwoofer levels of rumble. At maximum volume, however, digital signal processing (DSP) clearly kicks in and tamps down on that bass, making it sound weaker and more hollow than at more modest levels. The good news is that the drivers don’t distort; the bad news is that the loudest setting ends up sounding tame compared with lower volumes.,With the A30, the opening acoustic guitar plucks in Yes’ “Roundabout” received plenty of resonance and strong string texture thanks to clear treble response. However, it was too sharp and contained a minor, vinyl-like scratchiness that I haven’t heard using other headsets and headphones. The highest frequencies probably could have been rounded off a bit more to avoid that distraction, but once the music kicked in, it disappeared against the rest of the mix. The guitar strums, drums, and vocals cut through the track a bit aggressively, but the bassline came through with enough punch to balance it out. It’s still a highs- and high-mids-focused sound, though.,The almost harsh balance makes The Crystal Method’s “Born Too Slow” sound exciting. The backbeat gets proper low-frequency presence to drive the tracks, while the riffs and vocals stand out. A bit more bass would better anchor the mix, but it isn’t a bad sound.,The A30 puts out capable gaming audio, though the somewhat scooped sound emphasizes clarity for voices and sound effects more than bass for immersiveness. For example, Gundam Evolution's Guns, explosions, and beam weapons are clear, but they lack strong low-mid punch to make them powerful. Applying the Astro Immersion preset rather than Astro Footsteps preset keeps the higher frequencies from standing out far in front of all others, but it's still a touch weak in the lows and low-mids. The stereo panning works well with the PlayStation 5's 3D audio, with a good sense of shot directionality., demonstrates similar balance, with dialogue coming through clearly regardless of the surrounding environment. The environmental sounds and fairly laidback musical score have a strong presence, though they lack much low-end power. I took in the wind gusts while Geralt stood on a cliff in Skellige, but there was little body to give the impression of an oppressive rush. The fire crackle also stands out a bit, and the 3D audio lets you know where it's positioned.,The Astro Gaming A30 is a clean-sounding, flexible , with plenty of connectivity options and an attractive look. Unfortunately, it's fairly expensive at $229.99, and its audio performance and feel don't quite match that. The big benefit of the A30 over Astro's other wireless gaming headsets is the addition of Bluetooth, but we've reached a point where many competitors already have Bluetooth across a wide range of prices. The A30 tries to stand as a good middle ground between the A20 and A50, but that means it's much more expensive than the A20 and doesn't have the excellent build quality or charging dock of the A50. ,The Razer Barracuda X ($99.99) has nearly all of the same features and connection options as the A30. It lacks a carrying case or an Xbox-compatible version, but it has a better microphone and stronger low-frequency response for less than half the price. In the other direction, the more expensive Editors' Choice SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless ($349.99) has a fantastic sound and feel, hot-swappable batteries, and the ability to work with a PC and console at the same time.,The Logitech G Astro Gaming A30 tries to hit a pleasant middle ground among wireless gaming headsets, but it's too expensive for its sound and build quality.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

IronVest Review,"Shop online while retaining your privacy,When the IBM PC was new, I served as the president of the San Francisco PC User Group for three years. That’s how I met PCMag’s editorial team, who brought me on board in 1986. In the years since that fateful meeting, I’ve become PCMag’s expert on security, privacy, and identity protection, putting antivirus tools, security suites, and all kinds of security software through their paces.,IronVest lets you shop and communicate online without revealing your true email address, phone number, or credit card details, and it manages your passwords, too.,Security experts tell you not to , on the internet. That's good advice, but how does it work when you want to shop online? You’ve no choice but to give etailers your credit card to pay for the purchase, and they need your home address to ship your purchase. Add your email address to track shipments and you’ve given away a boatload of personal data. So, does protecting your privacy mean you have to just stop shopping online? Fortunately, no. IronVest is a , service that lets you shop while protecting your email address, credit card number, and more. In its previous incarnation as ,, IronVest perfected the process of communicating and shopping online while giving away minimal personal information. In its latest incarnation, IronVest Plus is an Editors' Choice winner for protecting your privacy.,IronVest's free edition blocks web trackers, masks your email address, and manages passwords. Once you try it, though, you'll almost certainly want the $39 per year Plus edition, which adds masked credit cards, masked phone numbers, and more. Each masked credit card costs an additional $2 to cover transaction-handling costs.,The $99 IronVest Ultimate gives you two masked credit cards for free and lets you create unlimited masked cards backed directly by your bank account. With a Plus account, you can have 50 custom-masked email addresses active at once; at the Ultimate level, there’s no limit.,As a new IronVest user, you can sign up for a 30-day trial of the Plus tier. That lets you try the product before committing to paying for it. Note that during the trial period, you don’t get access to masked phone numbers. Sign up online, create a password, verify with an emailed code, and you’re ready to begin. Note also that this master password protects access to your saved credential sets in the password manager component and protects your masked emails. Make it a ,.,After initial signup, IronVest offers to set up facial biometric authentication, a feature I’ll discuss later. You can skip this step altogether, or do it later.,A banner across the top of the page offers advice on using IronVest. Initially, it directs you to install the IronVest extension right away. This extension is available for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, with Safari coming soon. I found that after I installed the extension, the banner changed to suggesting I import passwords into the product.,The browser extension puts a single, simple button on the toolbar. Clicking the toolbar button brings up a small panel that in turn lets you disable or enable four major program functions: Accounts, Wallet, Masking, and Tracking. Those function toggles are a holdover from Blur and don’t entirely match IronVest’s style. Clicking Wallet or Masking just opens the main dashboard. When you’ve just started with IronVest, a button in the popup panel invites you to install the mobile edition. Your private data is all stored locally and synced between devices over an encrypted connection.,For full access to the program's dashboard, simply click the word IronVest at the bottom left of the pop-up panel. The dashboard contains large panels that offer access to five areas: Access Guard, Identity, Privacy, Pay, and Tracking. Two additional panels for Crypto Wallet and Phishing are marked as coming soon.,Each panel includes buttons to dig into one or two features. For example, in the Privacy panel, you can manage masked emails or masked phone numbers. Under Pay, you can record actual credit card numbers for form filling or manage your masked credit cards.,Each time you log in to a new device, IronVest sends an email requesting a verification code. If you get such a request when you didn’t ask for it, that's a red flag. Change your master password right away. If you get the message that “your device was authorized successfully” when you weren’t trying to authorize a device, that’s a top-level emergency. Click the link in the message to view your IronVest login sessions and immediately terminate any that don’t look familiar. It’s very unlikely you’ll have this experience, but nice to know that IronVest is prepared to help.,Your web surfing habits are nobody's business but your own. However, advertisers, social media sites, and web analytics groups all profit by tracking your activities online. Your browser can send a Do Not Track header, but it's toothless. Websites can and do ignore it. Abine pioneered the idea of a Do Not Track system that actively prevents this kind of tracking, and IronVest continues the tradition.,, ,, and , employ a similar active Do Not Track system, as do some traditional device-level security suites and antivirus products. The Avast and Ghostery products also work to disrupt tracking via ,, something IronVest does not attempt.,For each website you visit, the IronVest toolbar button in the browser displays how many trackers it detected and blocked. Clicking the button brings up the access panel for IronVest services; clicking Tracking in that panel displays full details. You can see exactly which ad aggregators, social media sites, and web analytics systems didn't get to track you, thanks to IronVest. This panel also lets you turn off blocking for any specific tracker, or for the entire website.,Clicking the Settings link at the bottom of the browser extension pop-up brings up a lengthy list of per-site settings, not all of them related to tracking. At the top is an option to turn off tracker blocking for the site. Next comes an option titled ,, turned off by default. Flipping this switch on causes IronVest to communicate privacy preferences to the site using a still-in-beta proposed protocol. I tried enabling this option on several well-known websites, but each time I got the message that the site “has seen your GPC privacy request but does not yet support it.” When GPC gains more traction, IronVest will be ready.,Continuing down the list of per-site settings you’ll find a handful related to password management and form filling, items such as whether IronVest should auto-fill credentials, suggest strong passwords, or auto-fill identity data. Finally, there are switches that control whether IronVest masks emails, credit cards, or phone numbers on this site. Most users will probably go with global settings rather than digging in on settings for each site.,As a new IronVest user, you experience an initial push to import your existing passwords. In addition to importing its own exported data, IronVest can import from 1Password, Dashlane, ,, LastPass, PasswordWallet, RoboForm, and Chrome. It can also import a properly formatted CSV file. You also install the extension in the browsers you use. Finally, you create a long, strong master password. Provided that you remember that master password, IronVest takes care of the rest.,By the same token, if you forget your master password, you lose all your saved passwords. To avoid that awkward situation, IronVest generates what it calls a Backup Passphrase. Mine consisted of 12 words, more than 70 characters. You can use this passphrase to regain access to your passwords in an emergency—but so can anyone else who gets hold of it. I suggest you print it off and store it in a fireproof lockbox or other secure location.,As a password manager, IronVest works as expected, capturing credentials when you log in and filling those credentials when you revisit the site. If you've saved more than one set of credentials, it offers a menu of available logins. In my testing, it did not capture Google’s two-page login, so I had to enter that one manually. Even with manual entry, automated login failed with an odd error message from Google. My IronVest contact confirmed this behavior and suggested disabling Auto Submit for Google as a quick fix.,From the online dashboard, you can view a list of all your passwords and optionally edit or delete entries. Like LastPass, ,, and many others, IronVest lets you assign a friendly label to each saved password. You can't organize entries into groups or categories, but IronVest does include icons to access any masked emails or cards related to the entry.,As noted, if you’re , you can import passwords from LastPass, Dashlane, RoboForm, and several others. That's good, but , imports from more than 30 competitors, and KeePass from nearly 40.,You can enhance the protection of your stored passwords by enabling ,. IronVest supports authentication using , such as Twilio Authy or Duo Mobile. You can also set it to lock automatically after a period of inactivity or when the browser restarts.,IronVest offers to , when you're signing up for a new service or changing an existing password. Initially, it offers a 10-character password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Just ten characters is unusually short, given that you don't have to remember the generated password, and given that many users just accept the default. Password Boss and , default to 20 characters, while F-Secure Key and the free , both generate passwords of 32 characters by default.,You can click Show Password Preferences to take more control over the password generator, starting with the ability to raise the password length as high as 25 characters. You can also disable digits or special characters for sites that don't accept them. However, your generated passwords always include capital and small letters, and any customization you do doesn't stick around for the next time you need a random password. ,, Dashlane, LastPass, and many others give you full control over the character sets used.,IronVest syncs your stored data across multiple PC, Mac, or mobile devices. It encrypts your data locally, so nothing is exposed to the company. You can also opt for local-only storage, but even IronVest's own FAQ advises caution, as you could lose your saved passwords. If you must use local-only storage, be sure to export your data frequently.,The list of passwords reports the total number of accounts, the number with reused passwords, and the number using masked emails. Surprisingly, it doesn’t flag those with , passwords. ,, Keeper, ,, and a few others have an actionable password strength report that lists all your passwords from weakest to strongest. Some go even further, automating the process of updating passwords on popular websites.,IronVest doesn't include typical advanced password manager features like secure sharing of passwords or digital password inheritance after your death, but it does offer some unusual features like Passcode Protection and Biometric Protection. Both are disabled by default, so your first step is to open Settings and turn them on.,Biometric Protection refers to enabling authentication by facial recognition. The process starts with a few explanatory pages, including a statement that IronVest “deconstructs and manages your biometrics on a decentralized network” for maximum security. I set this up using a Mac, as my virtual machine testbeds don’t have webcams.,This proved awkward because, thereafter, IronVest expected to use facial recognition on , devices. To log in on my virtual machine, I had to request a biometric override using an emailed code. Biometric Backup is extremely similar. It uses facial recognition specifically to fill in your backup passphrase when needed.,As for Passcode Protection, it turns out to be a beta feature, but a very cool one. It adds a level of protection to all logins that require you to enter a passcode texted to your phone. For any site where you want this protection, you must switch the phone number for receiving those texts to your IronVest masked phone number. Now when you log in, IronVest captures the code from your masked phone number and fills it in automatically. The passcode text never even reaches your actual phone number. Wow!,Every time you give your email address to a website, you risk the possibility that the site owner will sell it to spammers or that hackers will steal your data from the site. IronVest solves that problem with masked email addresses. Instead of giving the site your actual address, you generate a masked address, along with a descriptive reminder for where you used this specific address. Messages sent to the masked address arrive in your inbox, and your replies seem to come from the masked address. The merchant or other website never sees your true address.,This kind of disposable email address (DEA) protection isn’t unique to IronVest. , and , offer a similar service at no charge, though with some limits on features. You can’t reply to messages received with Bulc Club, and you can’t change your main account email address with ManyMe. These two don’t put any limits on the number of DEAs you create, and both let you spin up a DEA on the fly without invoking the program. That last feature is something IronVest can’t do., and , aren’t free, but neither are they expensive. They provide a service much like Bulc Club and ManyMe, with the added option to protect your account using multi-factor authentication.,If you just create a random masked email, you’ll get something like ,. In most cases, that’s fine—you just want to communicate with privacy and don’t need to remember the DEA. But if you want something more easily shareable, you can create a custom-masked email. You choose from one of several domains, such as opayq.com or donottrackplus.info. You enter the custom part of the address, plus a label, and you’re done.,Well, almost. You can’t choose a custom-masked email that someone else has used. Sorry, , isn’t available! But you can always try a variation on the custom part or choose a different domain. Free users get just three custom addresses, those at the Plus level get 50, and those opting for Ultimate have no limits. All three tiers can create any number of random masked emails.,From the dashboard, click Masked Emails in the Privacy panel. This brings up a list of your masked email addresses, along with the number of times you've used each. If you start getting spam via one of these masked addresses, simply turn off mail forwarding or delete the address completely.,Click the Inbox button to view a temporary inbox that retains messages received via masked email addresses in the past two months. Typically, you'll review messages in your regular email client, but this view does give you a quick way to notice and disable a masked email that's become a spam sink.,Like Burner Mail and SimpleLogin, IronVest lets you define multiple target addresses to receive mail forwarded from masked emails. Bulc Club just allows one target at a time, and with ManyMe, you can never change your original target address.,If necessary, you can start a conversation from a masked address rather than wait for a merchant to initiate the connection. SimpleLogin offers a similar feature, which it calls Reverse Alias.,It’s a short step from filling in credentials on login pages to filling in personal data in web forms. IronVest separates personal data for form filling into three areas. Addresses and Identity Profiles are found in the Dashboard’s Identity panel, while Credit Cards appear in the Pay panel.,Addresses are simple snail mail addresses with name, street, apartment, city/state/zip, and country. Cleverly, IronVest just asks for the zip code and automatically fills in the corresponding state and city. There's no option for a second address line, but you might be able to use the apartment field.,Each Identity Profile has two tabs, Auto-Fill Preferences, and Your Info. On the first of those pages, you enter a full name, select an existing address (or create a new one), and indicate whether you want to use a specific email and phone number or use a masked one. By default, IronVest automatically generates a strong password for password fields and a masked card for credit card fields, though you can turn these options off.,On the Your Info page, you can enter your gender, date of birth, preferred username for new accounts, the URL of your website, your company, and title, your SSN, and your driver's license number. Other products offer a wider variety of data fields. For example, with Keeper, you can enter Home, Mobile, and Work phone numbers. , allows multiple instances of any field. But IronVest covers the basics.,You can only have one credit card backing your masked cards, but you can record details for any number of non-masked cards in the IronVest Wallet. You start by saving one or more snail-mail addresses, then enter each credit card's details and associate it with one of your addresses. That's it! The pop-up dialog that offers the masked credit card feature also lets you choose a non-masked card and fill in the details.,In testing on a Windows desktop, IronVest filled in almost all fields correctly and offered to gin up a masked credit card. Regardless of platform, every field that IronVest fills is one you don't have to type.,Unless you just sprang to life on this planet full-grown, you have a history online. You can start protecting your privacy with IronVest, but that won’t help claw back information you’ve already made public. Businesses called data brokers or data aggregators cash in on your public information, scraping it from legitimate sources and packaging it into a profile of you that they can then sell. And it’s all perfectly legal.,However, in order to stay on the bright side of the law, these brokers must remove your information from their databases on request. Of course, you can’t make such a request if you don’t know who has your data. , was a pioneer in the field of data broker opt-out as a service. And yes, that’s the same Abine that launched IronVest’s predecessor, Blur. DeleteMe searches common data broker sites for your data, sends an opt-out request on your behalf, and periodically checks in case the broker re-acquired a profile on you.,While DeleteMe pioneered this type of service, it hasn’t entirely kept up. , and , check vastly more sites than DeleteMe does. And Optery will report on the brokers that have your data at no charge, provided that you’re prepared to handle the opt-out requests manually.,IronVest doesn’t attempt to chase down your data that’s already loose on the internet. For comprehensive privacy protection, you may want to pair it with a data broker opt-out service.,Tracker blocking, password management, and masked email addresses are all available to users of IronVest's free edition. For access to masked credit cards and other advanced features, you must upgrade to the premium edition. New users get to try most premium features for free for 30 days.,Masked credit cards work much the same way as masked email addresses. You register an actual credit or debit card with IronVest. When you click in the credit card field to pay online, IronVest pops up and offers to create a masked card. The online merchant never sees your real credit card number. You can also fund masked cards directly from your bank account, though doing so is a beta feature. The big benefit here is that there’s no use fee when your masked cards are backed by the bank. If you feed cash to your masked cards from another credit card, you pay a $2 fee each time, plus 1.5% of transactions more than $100.,At the time you create the masked card, you fill in the precise amount that you're about to pay online. In truth, a masked credit card is more like a prepaid gift card that happens to hold precisely the amount needed for your current transaction. An unscrupulous merchant can't pad the bill, because the card's value is capped at the amount of the transaction.,When you confirm the creation of the masked card, IronVest bills your actual credit card for the amount you chose. On the shopping site, IronVest fills in its own address for billing and the address you select for shipping. The transaction appears on your credit card bill as a charge from IronVest. If you wind up not using the masked card, you can cancel it and request a refund with one click.,I tried the service, right up to the point of spending money. It worked very smoothly, and I had no trouble getting the correct amount refunded. Note that you can't create a masked card worth less than 10 dollars, but if you truly need to charge a smaller amount, you can spend it and then refund the remainder.,You can install IronVest on your Android or iOS phone or tablet and sync your data through the company's servers. Syncing is seamless, once you've set it up on your desktop. You get all the same features as the desktop edition, though the layout and precise functionality can differ slightly. For example, the password generator on Android defaults to 12 alphabetic characters with a maximum length of 30, while on the desktop it starts at 10 characters using all character sets and a maximum of 25 characters.,In addition, if you want features such as filling in masked emails and replaying passwords, you must register IronVest as an AutoFill source. I’m surprised the app itself doesn’t make this clear. But whether you’re running Android or iOS, it’s easy enough to search for AutoFill in settings and make the necessary adjustment.,The smartphone edition adds one major new feature—the ability to make calls while masking your phone number. Unlike masked emails and credit cards, the masked phone number is a singular new phone number that forwards calls, texts, and voicemails to your actual phone number. When filling out web forms, you can click Mask My Phone to enter the masked number.,All callers appear in the IronVest dashboard. If you don't want to receive any more calls from a number, just set forwarding to OFF for that number. The caller will hear a message stating that the number is no longer available. You can make calls from the masked number, and receive texts, but you can't send texts. You can't use masked phone numbers everywhere, but IronVest supports use in the US and the UK, as well as 18 other countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, and New Zealand.,Your subscription gets you $3 per month for masked phone usage. Each call and text costs one cent, and each minute of talking costs another penny. If you run out, you can add more in increments of $1, $2.50, or $5 directly from the app.,On an iPhone, if you want tracker blocking and access to all IronVest features you use the built-in browser or work in Safari via IronVest's extension. IronVest also offers instructions on how to tweak your iPhone's settings to limit advertiser tracking and location tracking. Android users can choose to enable IronVest in Chrome and other apps using Android's Accessibility feature. But in general, the feature sets are very similar between iPhone and Android.,The point of using IronVest is to protect your online privacy, but you necessarily give a ton of personal information to IronVest. Should you worry? IronVest's , details precisely which data items IronVest necessarily retains, and which items are completely out of the company's reach.,For example, the policy points out that IronVest must retain your email address and your masked email addresses, to seamlessly ensure that mail reaches your inbox. However, it encrypts your passwords locally on your device and transmits them in encrypted form for syncing, so IronVest has no access to them. The US government requires payment processors to retain purchase records, but IronVest won't share those (or anything else) with third parties. If served with a subpoena, the company would of course provide information to law enforcement, and that would include purchase records.,IronVest's policy page includes what's called a warrant canary, or canary post—a statement that IronVest has , been served with a FISA warrant or other secret subpoena. Recipients of such orders are forbidden to disclose them, but nothing says they can't delete the canary post.,Even more than its predecessor, Blur, IronVest Plus integrates the related services of managing and masking your personal information. It both remembers login credentials you’ve saved and spins up masked emails as needed. You can have it fill in an existing credit card number or create a one-use masked credit card. You can shop and communicate online seamlessly, while only sharing the necessary minimum of personal information. The product does have a few rough edges—things like references to Blur that didn’t get updated and oddly sized dialog boxes.

Fractal Design North Review,"Timber-faced tower takes PC cases into the woods,Years back, when a small website called out for product-review editors. I leapt at the opportunity: I’d just wrapped up a four-year stint as a systems supplier. That experience provided the credentials I’d need for the transition from industry supplier to industry observer. For one thing, I’d been the first source for an exposé on capacitor plague (,) at EDN. ,We'd opt for the glass-panel version instead of the mesh-side model we tested, but Fractal Design's North case has all the extra cooling and aesthetics it needs to attract buyers intrigued by its woodsy front face.,Wooden accents are far from new to the PC industry, yet they’re so rarely used that their appearance almost seems novel. The wooden slats of Fractal Design’s new North series ($129 for the wood-faced model we tested) set it apart from competing products, adding an air of opulence to an otherwise mundane product class. Previous trend-setters have included brushed-aluminum finishes and tempered-glass side panels, so will other companies copy the design theme? We hope so, but for now, the North is a solid tower in a class nearly of its own. If most of what you'll see of your PC is the front face, it's hard to find a more distinct, classy panel to expose to the world. ,Speaking of themes, the North is available in white with silver and oak trim in addition to the black with gold and walnut trim shown. The gold (or silver) trim applies to bands around the feet in addition to the power button, headphone and microphone jacks, Type A (Gen 1) and Type-C (Gen 2) USB 3.x ports. Both color themes are available with the buyer’s choice of mesh or tempered-glass panels on the left side.,Dust filtration is available only for the front and bottom panels, the latter being a slide-out filter that covers the power supply air inlet. That may be enough filtration for most builds, as the dual 140mm intake fans that hide behind the front panel will tend to push air , of the case’s other holes.,Zooming away from the power supply filter reveals a rear panel with removable power supply bracket, a seven-card expansion card hole that’s made without separators so that it can alternatively support a vertical card bracket, a 120mm fan mount with slotted holes that allow vertical spacing adjustment, and a fabric pull tab that helps builders remove the top panel cover. Also notice the six unused mounting holes on the far edge, which we’ll discuss in a few paragraphs.,The front-panel dust filter is removable from the back of the face panel, which itself can be removed from the rest of the case by pulling outward on its bottom edge.,While the side panel on the right is an ordinary painted sheet, left panels are available in both tempered-glass and mesh-faced varieties. The mesh part is reinforced as shown.,Here’s what the top panel's cover looks like removed. It has no filter, but many people who use its fan mounts may configure those fans as exhausts.,Under the cover is a mount large enough to fit the builder’s choice of two 120mm or two 140mm fans. Additional slots that look like they could hold fans don’t appear to be spaced for any familiar fan sizes.,Behind the painted-steel right side panel are a dual-2.5-inch-drive tray, a passive four-fan PWM power hub, a recessed cable loop, and a power-supply tunnel with two 3.5-inch drive trays. A box for the included hardware kit is included in one of the 3.5-inch bays, and all the extra mounting holes seen in the blown-up portion allow one of the trays to be slid forward in 1.5-inch increments. Power-supply length may be limited to as little as 165mm or extended up to 280mm depending on the number of trays installed and their placement.,Extra holes on the bottom of the 3.5-inch drive trays make these compatible with 2.5-inch drives, as well.,The power-supply tunnel is notched in front to support radiators up to 1.5 inches thick, which explains why the front drive tray can be moved backward 1.5 inches (after removing the rear drive tray): The available space is required by those who’d like to front-mount a so-called 360mm radiator.,Included in one of the 3.5-inch drive trays is a hardware kit with eight #6-32 shoulder screws and rubber grommets for damped mounting of 3.5-inch drives, a pack of eight #6-32 panhead screws for motherboard installation (one standoff has a key pin rather than a screw hole), 16 M3 screws for securing 2.5-inch drives, four #6-32 hex/Phillips combo head screws for securing the power supply, a spare standoff, and four ratcheting cable ties. The manual is packed separately on the outside of the case.,Front-panel cables include a power switch lead, power LED, HD Audio (for the headphone and microphone jacks), a Gen 1 cable for the two Type-A ports and a Gen 2 cable for the single Type-C USB 3.x port. Shown to the left of those are leads for the passive fan hub and two front fans, where those attached to fans have passthrough connectors to fit two , fans. Since the fan hub has no power source other than the motherboard’s fan header, builders should consider the output rating of their fan header before connecting everything through the hub.,Do you remember when we mentioned the six unused holes on the back panel? Those are designed to hold an accessory fan mount in one of three positions (upper/center/lower) behind the mesh side panel. The basket portion is only deep enough to hold normal (around 25mm thick) 140mm and 120mm fans, but crafty builders who can find the extra component clearance may choose to mount a radiator on the back side.,Components supplied specifically for these case reviews include Corsair’s , all-in-one CPU cooler and FSP’s , power supply. The cooler’s dual 120mm fans make it ideal for top-panel placement in most cases, which allows it to provide airflow around our motherboard’s CPU voltage regulator, while the Dagger Pro’s combination of SFX housing, a PS2 adapter plate, and mid-length power cables allow it to fit both compact and full-size cases.,The North manual we received makes no mention of top-mounting liquid cooling radiators, but with 1.25 inches of space above the board and almost 1.5 inches of horizontal offset away from the board for 120mm fan mounts, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to use our cooler to vent the board. Had there not been enough space here, our alternative would have likely been to mount the same cooler, in the same exhaust orientation, on the highest mounting locations of the optional side fan bracket.,One other thing I noticed is that Asus’ full-ATX (9.6-inch-deep) motherboard fits a full 1.25 inches behind the inward-angled cable passage holes. This means that those oversize (10.6-through-10.8-inch) enthusiast-class motherboards of the past will fit, even though this case doesn’t carry the Extended ATX (EATX) label.,The North has no lighting features beyond the power-on indicator that glows red next to USB ports on the top panel, but any lighted internal components are easily seen through its mesh side panel or through the front filter sheet as viewed between the wooden grille pieces. A tempered-glass version is available to builders who’d like to give others a clearer view of their internal components.,Because some of our devices round to the nearest whole number before that data is charted, it’s possible for two identical results to be shown as one degree apart due to rounding issues. The Fractal Design North appears to have the coolest CPU temperatures, but a slight chill in the air reminded us that it might actually be tied for first.,Differences of about 3 degrees are less ambiguous: The Fractal Design North cools our motherboard’s voltage regulator better than any case in this comparison set.,Remember what we said about a slight chill in the air? The North appears to be the second-worst at feeding cool air to our graphics card, but if not for possible rounding errors may have ended in an actual tie for worst.,Facing the question of how a case could have both the best voltage regulator and second-worst GPU temperatures in its class, we looked at the North’s factory front-fan placement just above the power-supply tunnel and determined that it should be perfect for GPU cooling.  We don’t like unanswered questions, but with one test point showing clearly superior performance and another showing merely acceptable performance, need we torture ourselves further?,Though it’s also available with a tempered-glass panel similar to its competitors, the version of the North we’re testing has a mesh left side that leaks noise just as easily as air. When heard from the other side, the case sounds similarly noisy to its competitors.,The mesh version is a bit noisy from one side, and we didn’t have the opportunity to test the tempered-glass version, but we’d call the North a solid performer when comparing the low CPU and chipset temperatures to the normal level of noise emitted from the opposite side. ,Discount the front face, and the North is a fairly typical modern PC case whether in its mesh or glass side-panel variants. The other accents are nice, but it's the wood-slat portion that really sets this case apart. Performance is generally on par for what it is, with the exception of the GPU thermal testing we did. But that may be cutting it too fine for a case like this; the aesthetics are the real selling point. ,The combination of connectors and internal features places the North solidly into the $120 price class, leaving buyers to decide whether the walnut or oak wood trim is worth the extra $10 of its $129 MSRP. It definitely gets , vote. To saw off one last pun, why woodn't you go for it, too?,We'd opt for the glass-panel version instead of the mesh-side model we tested, but Fractal Design's North case has all the extra cooling and aesthetics it needs to attract buyers intrigued by its woodsy front face.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Apple Music Review,"Music's golden apple,Since 2004, I've penned gadget- and video game-related nerd-copy for a variety of publications, including the late, great ,;,; ,; ,; ,; and ,. I now apply that knowledge and skillset as the Managing Editor of PCMag's Apps & Gaming team.,My career has taken me through an eclectic assortment of fields, and connected me with people from all walks of life. This experience includes construction, professional cooking, podcasting, and, of course, writing. I’ve been typing up geeky takes since 2009, ultimately landing a freelancing position at PCMag. This blossomed into a full-time tech analyst position in 2021, where I lend my personal insight on the matters of web hosting, streaming music, mobile apps, and video games. ,Apple Music’s radio stations, curated playlists, lossless audio, Dolby Atmos support, and excellent, music-related content elevate the service to the top of the streaming music hill., Apple continues to improve Apple Music, the company's ,. Apple Music has a massive catalog of more than 100 million songs, the curated Apple Music 1 radio station, Siri compatibility, video content, lyrics, a 24/7 music video channel, and support for numerous devices, including the Apple Watch. Apple has made the service even better by offering lossless audio and Dolby Atmos support at no additional cost. For its entertaining, ever-evolving features, Apple Music joins LiveOne, Sirius XM Internet Radio, Spotify, and Tidal as PCMag's top-rated, overall Editors' Choice pick for streaming music services.,Apple Music is a streaming music service that brings more than 100 million songs and a strong music video catalog to macOS, ,, tvOS, watchOS, CarPlay, HomePod, Windows, Android, Chrome OS, Amazon Echo, Sonos, and web browsers. So, if you own a consumer tech device, there's a good chance that you can use it to stream Apple Music.,Signing up is easy. Apple Music offers a one-month trial, which is a decent amount of time to try before you subscribe (you'll still need to supply credit or debit card info, though). After that, you must sign up for a subscription plan to continue using the service. The $10.99 per month Single Membership and the $16.99 Family Membership (for up to six people using iCloud Family Sharing) grant ad-free music listening, ad-free video watching, offline listening, and access to Apple Music radio (Apple's three human-curated, 24/7 channels). We like seeing Apple Music and other streaming music services adopt family plans, which is something that , still lacks. However, LiveOne makes up for it by offering a free-listening tier, which Apple Music lacks. , also has a Family Plan, one that gives six people ad-free, on-demand music listening for $14.99 per month.,Siri-loving Apple fans have the Apple Music Voice subscription tier to consider. For $4.99 per month, you can enjoy Apple Music's expansive 100 million-song catalog on any Siri-supported device. You lose out on Apple's premium offerings, including lossless audio, spatial audio, lyrics, music videos, and downloads. But if you want easy listening on Siri-supported devices, $4.99 is an excellent price point. This pricing is on-par with Amazon Music Unlimited, which offers a similar Single Device plan for $4.99, letting you use the service on one Amazon Echo or Fire TV device. ,If you're a college student who's enrolled in an eligible college or university, you can subscribe to Apple Music for a wallet-friendly $5.99 per month. Students can take advantage of the discount for up to four years. Spotify and Tidal offer a similar student deal, but at $4.99 per month.,Apple Music's layout features large, eye-catching icons that invite you to explore the service, be it via a browser or an app. Honestly, that's something that you're likely to do anyway, as the interface features a menu structure that helps you quickly find content. Library, Playlists, Artists, Albums, and Songs are all prominent and easy to navigate.,When you sign into the service for the first time, you'll be asked to pick your favorite music genres and a few sample acts. This populates the Listen Now page, giving you top songs from those artists and genres, plus tailormade radio stations. Alternatively, you can go to the Browse section to peruse Apple's featured playlists and albums. It's here that the service highlights some of its Spatial Audio tracks (with support for Dolby Atmos), which is useful if you have the company's AirPods Pro or another surround-sound headset. Finally, the Radio tab includes Apple's three radio stations—Music 1, Music Hits, and Music Country—alongside the additional content available on the service. This includes third-party radio stations, podcast-style radio shows (like Strombo and Elton John's Rocket Hour), and artist video interviews.,Apple Music features a vast selection of albums and songs, including Dr. Dre's ,, as well as tracks from Taylor Swift and other pop acts. We found many Prince albums, too, including ,, ,, and ,You can also listen to music channels dedicated to certain themes, such as Hip-Hop Workout Anthems and Disney Princess Radio. Looking into K-pop, we found that certain albums also include music videos for related singles. Like ,, Apple Music lets you jump from EXO's , audio stream to watching the music video with a single click. ,There are plenty of comedy tracks, too, for those times when you're in the mood to yuck it up. Maria Bramford, Kevin Hart, Eddie Murphy, Amy Schumer, Daniel Tosh, and Katt Williams are just a few of the notable comedians who have standup work on Apple Music.,Meanwhile, Apple's flagship radio station, Apple Music, features tracks curated by DJ Zane Lowe, along with artist interviews. In celebration of Apple Music's monumental 100-million-song milestone, the Apple Music Today radio show has been added to the service's program list. This show highlights one song from Apple's expansive catalog every day, and delves into the track's history. It's a fascinating listen, especially if you're a fan of ,'s editorial coverage. ,The service still segregates music from podcasts, unlike ,. If you want to listen to ,, Apple Podcasts is your destination. We understand why they keep the apps separate, but the options to jump from music listening to podcasts within the same app is great on Spotify. ,If you dig music videos, you'll be happy to know that Apple Music has a dedicated section for that medium. The videos are tailored to your preferences, too.,Apple Music has finally caught up to top competitors with the addition of non-compressed, lossless audio. Lossless music streams top out at 24-bit/48KHz, while hi-res, lossless streams top out at 24-bit/192KHz. With hi-res, lossless audio, Apple Music now matches Amazon Music Unlimited, ,, ,, and Tidal's , offerings. The streams support Spatial Audio with support for the excellent, immersive Dolby Atmos.,Apple Music supports a range of devices, but lossless audio is currently available only on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV 4K, and ,. The web player doesn't support lossless audio, and iTunes hasn't been updated for it, either. As a result, Windows PC users can't access lossless audio at all. In addition, only a fraction of the Apple Music catalog supports hi-res lossless streams. ,Still, we welcome this enhanced sound quality. We loaded up , by Chika—which is not only lossless, but also an Apple Digital Master for enhanced quality—and loved the clear separation between the choir samples and that bumpin' bass line. We even found the , , in lossless quality; every instrument sounded great, from ,' pipe organ to ,'s smooth violins.,What would an Apple service be if it didn't encourage you to use other Apple services and products? You can use Siri to tell Apple Music to play specific songs or ask for recommendations, like The Top Songs of the 80s. , owners can sync music to their devices, and keep listening even when the timepiece isn't paired to an iPhone. Apple Music supports lyrics (when they are available), so you can sing along to a song, even if you don't know the words. ,While many Apple Music songs feature real-time lyrics, Apple has gone one step further by introducing a new karaoke feature for subscribers. Called ,, it is available on supported iPhones, iPads, and Apple TVs. Simply open the Apple Music app and play a song. Tap the quote icon at the bottom left of the screen, then use the microphone icon above the music controls to turn the vocal volume up or down. ,This feature does a few interesting things to simplify the karaoke experience. First, lyrics animate in real time to make singing along easier. Background vocals are left intact, with these lyrics animated independently and in a smaller font under the main vocal lyrics. For songs with multiple vocalists, lyrics are presented on opposite sides of the screen to make duets and multi-singer tracks easy to follow. ,This feature is not available with all songs on Apple Music. That said, Apple has launched it with more than 50 dedicated companion playlists, giving you plenty of music to sing to right from the jump. ,As mentioned, Apple Music Sing can only be used with compatible devices. For iPhones, these are the iPhone SE (3rd generation) and the iPhone 11 and later when using iOS 16.2 or later. For iPads, these include the iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation and later), iPad Air (4th generation or later), iPad mini (6th generation), or iPad (9th generation and later), with iPadOS 16.2 or later. Apple TV 4K (3rd generation) is also supported.,Apple Music has proven itself a solid music streaming service since its debut, but it lacked a truly killer feature to help it stand out in a crowded field. That's changed with the Apple Music TV, a 24/7, ad-free music video stream that recalls MTV's heyday (minus the VJs).,Found in Apple's Apple Music and Apple TV apps (it's not a part of ,!), Apple Music TV focuses on popular, youth-centric tunes. In our tests, the service served up videos by Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, and Alicia Keys. Well, those are the artists we recognized; sadly, Apple Music TV lacks metadata that informs you of what's playing. So, if you happen upon a music video in the middle of its broadcast, there's no way to identify the song or performer. That's a major music discovery oversight. Apple Music TV isn't just wall-to-wall videos. The service also breaks things up with artist interviews, live performances, and themed artist takeovers. ,Apple Music's 30-day free trial is a decent length of time to determine whether the service is one you want to invest in. (Just make sure to turn off auto-payments in case you don't dig it.) However, chances are that if you're a music fan, you'll appreciate what the service offers. Apple Music features over 100 million tracks, excellent music video content, and cool, human-curated radio stations. The higher price point may be a sticking point for some people, since the service is now slightly more costly than many of its competitors. But if you don't mind that Apple Music lacks non-music content beyond comedy, such as LiveOne's Stories or Spotify's podcasts, you'll find a lot to love. For that, Apple Music is an Editors' Choice pick for streaming music services. ,For more on streaming music, check out , and ,.,.),Apple Music’s radio stations, curated playlists, lossless audio, Dolby Atmos support, and excellent, music-related content elevate the service to the top of the streaming music hill.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Eric Vander Linden,"From an early age I was destined for a career in technology and testing. As a young child, my mother worked as the administrative assistant to the Senior VP of Hardware and Peripherals at a little startup called Microsoft, long before they went public. The test and design engineers invited me often to the office, because if anything can break a computer peripheral, it's a 3-year-old toddler. They let me use a heavily modified IBM PCjr running MS Flight Simulator, that could also run Pac-Man at near superluminal speeds.,Computers and games stayed a big part of my childhood, whether it was Jumpman on my C64, Arkanoid on the Amiga, or California Games in all its green monochrome glory on my tricked-out Tandy 1000 SX. I still remember my mother's stern warning about what would happen if I managed to fill the gigantic 5MB hard drive with my games. I built my first computer from scratch using spare parts in the high-school tech lab and haven't stopped since. The teachers often asked me for tech support, and I was probably the only student who knew the difference between expanded and extended memory.,I stumbled into QA work after college, since English majors with advanced math, physics, electronics, and programming skills don't have conventional career paths. Evidently, being able to proofread documentation, math equations, and lines of code equally well is a valuable skillset in software development. I started writing for Tom's Hardware in 2015, covering motherboards, liquid cooling, and full system builds. In 2017 they hired me full-time to work in their parent company product testing lab. I love testing and reviewing hardware as it combines my passions of writing, photography, experimenting, and cool gadgets all into one. Plus, I get to play with ridiculously expensive things I couldn't even touch otherwise.,PC building and configuration,Motherboards,Custom liquid cooling,Creating and refining testing processes and methodologies,Generic evil machinations,My wife would ask, ""What technology DON'T I use?"" Two laptops serve as my daily drivers: an older 8th Generation Intel Dell as the main workhorse and a newer AMD Ryzen 5000 system for heavier compute loads and light gaming. As laptop keys and touchpads have all the tactility of warm Jell-O, a full-size mechanical keyboard (brown switches only, please) and good mouse are a necessity. Sadly, I've yet to see a mouse that surpasses the old Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer or Logitech MX Revolution.,On my workbench, you'll find screwdrivers, spudgers, flashlights, calipers, a multimeter, and some re-flashed/repurposed network routers. For my photography work I use a Canon dSLR, various light stands, and (occasionally) my Air 2 drone. Sadly, my 35mm T70 often stays in its bag for years at a time. I use a few Raspberry Pis in my home, one as a radio hotspot, and one as a travel media and entertainment unit.,Leftover computer parts I haven't used to make home servers end up on my shelves, along with old peripherals and my practically antique Windows 98 and Windows XP systems. Maybe I'm nostalgic, maybe I'm a bit of a pack rat, but until you've played Final Fantasy VII on a Voodoo2 with Yamaha XG synth music, or MechWarrior 3 with a SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick, you haven't experienced the fullness of PC gaming.,I call myself a pragmatic enthusiast as I like to focus on usefulness and performance-versus-value, not just pure performance at any cost. I'm a tinkerer and experimenter at heart, and I love finding tech and gadgets that are , for a given task. When building a computer, I try to optimize performance for a certain purpose while staying at a minimum cost. Identifying the critical components that need top-tier parts, and finding the places you can shave costs for minimal performance loss, is always a satisfying puzzle to solve.,Asrock's B660 Steel Legend is a decent board for home office and productivity use, but the extra controllers added to compensate for the chipset’s limitations make it pricier than some H670 rivals.,The Asus Strix Z690-E Gaming WiFi is a well-done Intel LGA1700 motherboard with top-notch power delivery and copious storage support.

Asrock B660 Steel Legend Review,"Digital camouflage is the main draw of this Intel LGA1700 board,Asrock's B660 Steel Legend is a decent board for home office and productivity use, but the extra controllers added to compensate for the chipset’s limitations make it pricier than some H670 rivals.,While gamers and power users may be the most obvious marketing segment for hardware manufacturers, their total number falls far below the mainstream business and home users. The Steel Legend line is typically aimed at office and productivity users, though Asrock outfits it far above a strictly “business only” trim. With its ,, fancy PCB design and RGB lighting is included, not things that usually rank high on the office priority list. But who says productivity users don’t appreciate good looks? The full ATX version of the B60 Steel Legend has an MSRP of $149, meaning stiff competition from other robust and well-rounded boards. It's a competent enough option for Intel LGA1700 CPUs, but we'd like it more at a Jackson or so less.,As mentioned above, the Steel Legend may be intended for “boring” productivity work, but the board itself is rather eye-catching. The board uses what might be easiest described as an arctic digital camouflage motif, grey and white silkscreening over the black PCB. ,Contrasting brushed and bead-blasted surface finishes continue the design on the aluminum heatsinks. For added style, RGB lighting is embedded in the front edge spelling out the Steel Legend name and logo. Included in the box are also a Steel Legend keychain, a Steel Legend logo keycap for mechanical keyboards, and two hook-and-loop straps for cable management.,Those unfamiliar with the differences between Intel's 600-series chipsets can read our detailed breakdown ,. While it’s fair to say most users won’t notice any difference between Z690 and H670 boards, apart from overclocking, the B660 chipset has drastically reduced storage options that need to be considered.,PCI Express (PCIe) and SATA lanes are cut in half compared to Z690, leaving a maximum of six PCIe 4.0 lanes, eight PCIe 3.0 lanes, and four SATA 6Gbps ports. Since the CPU already has its own PCIe 5.0 x16 and 4.0 x4 lanes for the primary expansion card and M.2 storage drive, B660 boards will most likely use their 4.0 lanes for a for a second 4.0 x4 M.2 slot. However, the eight 3.0 lanes will be very limited to cover additional PCIe storage, peripherals, and expansion card slots. Expect most B660 boards to have limited expansion options, limited bandwidth for devices, multiple devices sharing connection lanes, or all the above. RAID support over PCIe has also been cut, though SATA RAID is still supported.,On top of that, the B660 has only four DMI 4.0 lanes connecting it to the CPU, whereas both Z690 and H670 have eight. As the DMI carries all storage and peripheral traffic from the chipset to the CPU, this could be a significant bottleneck. A single PCIe 4.0 x4 drive could saturate the DMI on its own. Add SATA drives, USB devices, and expansion cards onto the bus, and you can see the potential problem.,USB 3.x lanes are almost identical to H670, so not much is lost there that will affect mainstream and business users. The maximum count of USB 2.0 ports is reduced from 14 to 12, and 5Gbps USB ports drop from eight to six. Two 20Gbps and four 10Gbps USB ports are still on hand for high-speed external devices.,Now, stress tests on a bench don’t always reflect real-world use, so this isn’t all doom and gloom. B660 is often a lower mainstream and business solution. Using multiple PCIe storage drives is unlikely in such a role. When only using a single PCIe drive, the DMI has plenty of bandwidth for multiple SATA drives, Ethernet traffic, and a high-speed USB drive. If all four SATA ports hosted high-performance SSDs, and several USB 3.2 ports were in use (particularly both 20Gbps ports), the DMI could be a bottleneck. But realistically, the B660 DMI won’t be a limitation so long as you only use one NVMe drive through the CPU.,Without CPU overclocking support, the VRM uses an understandably modest nine-phase design and only a single 4+4 EPS connector. The Steel Legend officially supports 125-watt and 150-watt Core i7 and Core i9 CPUs, even if it’s unlikely to be done much in the wild. Be sure to keep proper airflow across the VRM heatsinks if you install one of the higher-end CPU SKUs on this board.,Asrock chose to stay with DDR4 on the Steel Legend, fitting for its intended use. The B660 chipset still supports RAM overclocking. One specific Kingston DDR4-5333 kit is listed on the QVL, though most are DDR4-4600 or under.,Extra connectivity takes some strange turns due to the B660 chipset’s limited connection lanes. Two full-length PCIe slots are available, with the top slot as usual connecting to the CPU at 5.0 x16 rates. The other is limited to 4.0 x2. The remaining two PCIe slots are open-ended and support 3.0 x1 connections.,The board has three M.2 slots. The top one, above the main PCIe slot, has a heat shield with thermal pad and connects directly to the CPU at 4.0 x4 bandwidth. The second slot is limited to a 3.0 x2 connection, but it can also operate in SATA mode. The last is below the chipset and operates at 4.0 x4. All three slots will fit 60mm and 80mm drives, while the third slot can hold up to 110mm drives. ,Despite the B660 chipset being limited to only four SATA ports, the Steel Legend has six. Asrock added an ASM1061 controller for the extra two ports. Two are along the bottom edge, perpendicular to the board, and the other four are along the front edge by the chipset heatsink, facing forward. The second M.2 slot and first SATA port share lanes, so the two cannot be used simultaneously in SATA mode.,The rear I/O is fairly plain. On the top is a keyboard and mouse stack, with one PS/2 port and two USB 2.0 ports for basic peripherals. The four blue USB ports are all USB 3.2 Gen 1 5Gbps, and the lone Type-C port is USB 3.2 Gen 2 10Gbps. For onboard graphics, an HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 are there. ,The Steel Legend does have BIOS Flashback capability, and a control button for that by the USB ports. Onboard audio is provided by a RealTek ALC897 codec, with the usual five 3.5mm jacks and one fiber optic connector. For networking, instead of using the integrated chipset network controller, a RealTek 2.5Gbps RTL8125BG is used. No Wi-Fi is provided onboard, but a dedicated Wi-Fi M.2 slot is below the third PCIe slot, and the rear I/O shield does have cutouts for mounting antennas.,Three four-pin fan headers and two addressable RGB headers are in the top right corner of the board. The RGB lettering down the front edge takes up a fair amount of space, pushing the 24-pin ATX power connector and two USB 3.2 headers, one 2x2 20Gbps and one 10Gbps, back toward the RAM sockets. Below the top four SATA ports is another fan header.,The headers along the bottom edge are what you would expect: HD Audio, and two more RGB headers (one generic addressable, one Asrock Polychrome compatible). Six fan headers are available for cooling use, one just above the CPU socket, one by the primary M.2 slot, and the rest scattered down the front edge of the board. Going down the front edge, you'll find two addressable RGB headers, a POST status LED cluster, the 24-pin ATX power connector, and an odd arrangement of USB 3.2 headers. The Riptide has the expected USB 3.2 Gen 1 header, and even a 2x2 20Gbps connector, but the second Gen 1 header is surprising, even more that it's forward facing.,The rest of the internal connectors along the bottom edge are pretty standard fare: HD Audio, two more RGB headers (one generic addressable, one for Asrock Polychrome Sync), TPM, two USB 2.0 headers, two fan headers, a clear CMOS jumper, the front-panel-connection cluster, and the other two SATA ports.,As the B660 Steel Legend was meant primarily for productivity use, assessing the layout requires a different outlook. But really, there aren’t any surprises here. The VRM heatsinks leave plenty of room for even large CPU coolers, which likely won’t ever be used on this board. We always want more fan headers in more places on a board to make it as convenient as possible for fan placement in a case, but the seven fan headers it already has should be sufficient for any cooling this board will need. Also unlikely is using any expansion card in the bottom slot, so no headers there will be blocked.,Perhaps the only annoyance, given the Steel Legend’s price and intended market segment, is placing the first and second SATA ports on the bottom edge of the board. Using these ports makes SATA cable management not quite as sleek as it can be if the forward-facing ports are used. There is, of course, no harm in using the other ports, but it might be a nagging problem to more fastidious users who prefer to attach drives in ascending order.,The Steel Legend’s UEFI uses a digital camouflage pattern as a background to match the graphics on the board, but otherwise it’s the same as other Asrock boards. As we’ve already covered it in-depth in other reviews, we won’t spend a lot of time reiterating the details here. ,By default, entering the UEFI defaults to EZ mode where you can manage nearly everything you might need to on this board since overclocking and tweaking options are limited. Applying memory XMP profiles, changing drive boot order, updating the firmware, and changing the system fan profiles are all available.,The Advanced Mode is available if you want to specially tune your RAM settings, set configuration profiles, monitor storage drive specifics, change CPU power settings, or use the secure erase utilities for flash drives. All this you can do at native FHD resolutions instead of stretched 1,024-by-768 displays, thanks to Asrock’s support for extended display resolutions.,To customize the RGB lighting of the board and connected devices, Asrock includes a fairly robust Polychrome utility directly within the UEFI. Whereas many boards limit RGB customization within the UEFI to a few presets, the Steel Legend allows full configuration for colors and patterns to individual headers and devices or all together.,The Steel Legend uses Asrock’s typical group of Windows utilities to allow the user to tweak the motherboard without entering the UEFI. The App Shop shows available software and utilities for your particular motherboard and includes an Update section for downloading drivers. Combined with the integrated Ethernet driver in the UEFI, it allows new builds to get updated quickly and running smoothly.,The A-Tuning application continues to work as the performance and overclocking utility for the motherboard. Some of the more obscure power and voltage settings are accessible only from the UEFI, but nearly everything else is mirrored here. The B660 can’t overclock a CPU, of course, but you can increase the stepdown multipliers up to the CPU’s maximum to keep the cores running as fast as possible when multiple cores are in use. Fan auto-tuning, five-point curve profiles, and system environment monitoring are also here.,Much of this review has been trying to find new ways of saying “fairly typical,” “as expected,” and the like (sometimes in a good way, sometimes not). Often, it’s a positive when products ,surprise you, because it means they meet expectations. However, the B660 Steel Legend also has an atypically high MSRP. A good chunk of that price increase undoubtedly comes from the added SATA and 2.5Gbps Ethernet controllers. But do those additions bring enough functionality and value to warrant their inclusion?,Perhaps having only four SATA ports may look bad compared to similarly priced H670 boards with as many as eight. But how many office desktops being built now need more than four SATA drives? Similarly, it’s fancy to say your motherboard supports 2.5Gbps Ethernet, but those ports require a 2.5Gbps-capable network to be of any use.,Most consumers expect B660 motherboards to cost less than H670 boards. It’s understandable for a full-featured B660 to cost more than a stripped-down H670. But the problem the B660 Steel Legend faces is that it costs more than some very good H670 boards, not least of which is its own stablemate, the ,. Compared to the Steel Legend, the Riptide has the same CPU and RAM performance, two more USB 3.2 ports on the back, and none of the B660’s storage bottlenecks, all for a lower price. Exchanging that for a faster Ethernet controller and two additional SATA ports doesn’t seem like a wise trade for most buyers.,Had this board accepted and worked within the B660 chipset’s limitations, and really embraced the idea of a productivity-first motherboard, things could have been different. Start with the B660 to shave a little off component cost, accept that four SATA ports are sufficient for the mission statement, and stop at two M.2 slots. Work computers are fine with regular audio jacks; no need for 7.1 rear audio connectors or TOSLINK. The digital camo design can stay, but remove the onboard RGB effects. (The RGB headers can go, too, and no need for a keychain in the box.),Bring that board to market and make it price-competitive, and you have a winner at the LGA1700 low end. As it is, this Steel Legend seems to spends too much time trying to compensate for its chipset and forgets that sometimes, a budget chipset is budget for a reason: to keep the board basic.,Asrock's B660 Steel Legend is a decent board for home office and productivity use, but the extra controllers added to compensate for the chipset’s limitations make it pricier than some H670 rivals.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

OneDrive has attractive and capable web and mobile interfaces, photo AI tagging, real-time collaborative editing, and powerful search. The service's deep integration with Windows and Microsoft 365, alongside its completeness, maturity, and polish, earn it not only an Editors' Choice award, but also a rare five-out-of-five rating.,OneDrive has apps not only for Windows PCs, but also for macOS, Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, and Xbox. Everything it stores is also available in any web browser you log in to. OneDrive integrates seamlessly with , apps and includes rich photo-management features. Apple's competing iCloud has no app for Android (the , in the world), and its website lacks basic functions like search. Recent OneDrive feature adds include , and the ability to cast photos to a TV via Chromecast, to organize photos by date or source, and to filter by folder. ,Like , and Google Drive, OneDrive serves a lot of functions. If you just want access to documents or media files, it offers simple online storage accessible from the web. If you want the same set of files replicated on multiple PCs, it provides syncing. For Windows 10 and , users, it backs up device settings, including images for your lock screen and desktop background, as well as browser favorites. It also syncs Microsoft 365 documents and enables coauthoring.,Coming to OneDrive in 2023 are a redesigned Home screen, offline web syncing, more sharing and collaboration options, file favoriting, Teams integration, and macOS Desktop and Document folder backup. A private shared photo (and video) story feature with followers is also coming soon.,There are a few different cross-sections from which you can view the service: by type of data, client, or function. The data types include documents, photos, video, music, and settings. The clients include computer, mobile, and web, and the functions are things like syncing, viewing, playing, and simple storage. Here we look at the service from these various angles. ,Anyone with a Microsoft account already has a OneDrive account, and that includes everyone who's ever signed up for a Hotmail, Live, or Outlook.com email account. You can also sign up with any email provider. ,Free users get 5GB free storage space, and some smartphones and PCs add free OneDrive storage. For comparison, iCloud offers 1GB free, unless you bought an Apple device, which gets you 5GB. Dropbox gives you 2GB for free. IDrive offers 10GB. , gives you 15GB, though that's shared with Gmail. Other smaller players like Mega and , also offer more free space but fewer features.,Microsoft 365 users get a terabyte more with their $6.99-per-month Personal subscription, along with features like expiring and password-protected share links, ,, and downloadable Microsoft 365 programs. A $9.99-per-month Home subscription includes 6TB (1TB each for six users). Another option is to add 200GB of storage to OneDrive for $1.99 per month, though you lose the just-mentioned benefits. Apple, Dropbox, and Google all charge $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage.,The OneDrive desktop syncing runs on Windows 7 through Windows 11 and macOS 10.12 or later. There are workarounds for using it on Linux, but no first-party client app. The OneDrive mobile app runs on Android 6.0 or later and iOS 14.0 or later. It's also available in the Amazon AppStore for Kindle Fire. The desktop syncing app is quick to install, with a setup wizard that lets you create an account if you don't already have one. The setup shows how your OneDrive folder will appear in Windows Explorer (or Finder), with its little blue cloud icon instead of the traditional yellow folder icon. Setup also places a cloud icon in your system tray, from which you can open your synced folder or change settings.,When you place a photo, document, or other item in the created OneDrive folder, it automatically uploads to the cloud and then appears in any of your other OneDrive clients on any of your other computers. You can now upload files of up to 250GB in size—larger than most people will ever need, but not as big as Google Drive's 5TB (though for , the size is much smaller). You can share any files or folders stored in the OneDrive cloud with either viewing or editing privileges. Paid OneDrive users can password-protect shared files as well as set expiration times for sharing. Apple and Google's cloud services don't offer either at any plan level, without workarounds or third-party add-ins.,For a quick test of cross-platform syncing, I installed OneDrive on both an iMac and a Windows desktop. I then created a new folder in the OneDrive app, which appeared a couple seconds later in the Mac's OneDrive folder. Including OneDrive in Windows Explorer is incredibly helpful because you can save work from any application to your cloud storage directly, without having to go to a website. That includes apps that autosave files. I should note, however, that iCloud and Google Drive desktop utilities can do the same.,OneDrive has multiple functions and features. The most important ones to highlight are device syncing, folder and file syncing, Personal Vault, folder backup, and synced Microsoft 365 collaboration.,OneDrive can sync settings and apps on all your Windows desktops, laptops, and tablets. Clients for iOS, Android, and macOS give users of those devices access to the synced files stored in OneDrive's online folders.,OneDrive lets smartphone users with iPhones or Androids running the OneDrive app to automatically upload photos and videos taken with the phone's camera to OneDrive's camera roll. iCloud, Dropbox, and other services have this option, too. With automatic mobile photo backup, your images and videos are quickly available for viewing online in a OneDrive folder on a PC, in ,, on the web, or in any other OneDrive app you have installed.,OneDrive's file and folder syncing is similar to what you get from , and ,. In the past, Microsoft had separate storage and syncing services. The joining of online storage and syncing into one cloud service is a refreshing simplification of a previously somewhat confusing set of systems.,OneDrive's Personal Vault adds an extra degree of security for files you store on OneDrive. When you enable your Personal Vault, you must use , to open it. It can take the form of a security code to your email, phone, or , (we recommend the latter for best security). The files are locally encrypted by BitLocker, they lock after a set number of minutes of inactivity (which varies by device), and you can't share them accidentally.,Unlike true ,, OneDrive doesn't let you sync any file in any folder on your local drive to the cloud. But the Backup choice in Settings, does let you protect the three most likely suspects for backup: Desktop, Documents and Pictures. These folders don't have to live inside the OneDrive folder to be synced.,When you create a document in a Microsoft 365 app like Word or Excel in your OneDrive folder, it's not only accessible from any device and the web, but also available for real-time collaborative editing.,With Windows 11, OneDrive is more of a built-in capability than a separate web service. You see OneDrive in the File Explorer, and you can choose which OneDrive folders are synced or have everything synced. Results in Windows desktop searches or Cortana searches include OneDrive files, and the , can play music files you upload to it.,As of September 2022, the Windows 11 version of OneDrive has a slick new Settings panel, where you can choose whether to turn on Files On Demand, PC backup, and more.,One of the greatest things to ever happen to OneDrive is its implementation of Files on Demand. With it enabled from OneDrive's Settings panel, you no longer have to fill up every connected computer's drive with every file stored in the OneDrive cloud. Instead, as the name implies, the files are only downloaded on-demand as you open them. OneDrive's Files on Demand is available in the macOS OneDrive client, too.,You can still designate folders and files to be downloaded for offline use. A column in File Explorer called Status shows a cloud icon for online files and folders, and a circled check mark for items stored locally. Files waiting to be uploaded sport a circular-arrows icon. In my usage, the feature works flawlessly. Google has added a similar capability to Google Drive, but Apple's iCloud Drive still has no on-demand capability for its Windows client, but it works on-demand by default for Macs and iOS devices.,I already mentioned the availability of Android and iOS apps for OneDrive, but mobile apps for OneDrive have also made the jump beyond the smartphone: , and Wear OS versions are now available, which let you do things like cycle through recent photos on the watch face. Tablets running iPadOS, Windows 10, and Android can also take advantage of OneDrive apps, and failing that, there's always the excellent web interface.,The mobile apps let you not only view anything stored up in your OneDrive, but also can upload files and share anything stored via the cloud to any app on the phone that can accept files. You can even see photos grouped by autogenerated tag subjects like #people, #animal, #building, and so on.,I tried out mobile access to OneDrive on iPhone and Android. The OneDrive apps clearly show your cloud folders or file icons, and they even let you view photos and documents (including spreadsheets and PDFs) within the app. They also let you share anything in the folders via an email link (with view only, edit, and expiration options), or you can copy items to the phone's clipboard. You can also designate files for offline viewing and editing.,Happily, Microsoft has added a search capability to the mobile apps. All of the mobile apps also now let you automatically upload any photos (and optionally videos) shot on the device using the Automatically Upload to OneDrive option. You can watch videos on the phone, too. One cool thing is the ability to upload photos from the iPhone's camera roll or other galleries, marking multiple folders for upload. ,Another OneDrive option for mobile users is the collection of Microsoft 365 mobile apps—Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile, and OneNote. They're available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 (both desktop and mobile), and on the web. When you open an office document in the OneDrive app, you can view it, and you can launch the editing app (such as Word) from its icon at the top. In fact, the web version of OneDrive offers a big dropdown menu of tiles for all these online apps. Documents you create in them are automatically synced to all your OneDrive access points.,Microsoft's cloud service plays and displays all the most common types of files you might want to store in the cloud, including documents, music, photos, and video. Here's a rundown of how each is handled:,You can not only download and upload document files, as you can with iCloud's web interface, but also view and edit them online with OneDrive using the integrated Microsoft 365 Online apps. In fact, OneDrive serves as the main folder and file location for all your online documents made with those apps, just as Google Drive does for Google Docs. And just as in Google Docs, multiple authors can edit documents at the same time. An icon shows who's typing where, and the document contents are updated live. Microsoft 365 Online also offers better document-formatting fidelity than you get with Docs.,I had no problem viewing Microsoft file formats like Word Documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations using the online Microsoft 365 apps. I could also view PDFs, and Windows knew to open a ZIP file on the desktop, showing the archive's contents in a folder. Microsoft 365 apps have OneDrive baked in, too, as the default save location. It's especially convenient when you want to work on a file at home that you started at work.,Windows 11's Media Player and Windows 10's Groove app let you play songs stored on OneDrive. It's not streaming, however, as the files must be downloaded to play them. Google Play Music does the same for Android users. OneDrive's web version can play songs via streaming, as can Google Drive's, but iCloud's cannot, and Apple Music can't access songs stored on iCloud Drive.,OneDrive does an impressive job of displaying photos and videos in its web interface. It even auto-tags images using AI the way Flickr does, grouping, for example, all photos of dogs, crowds, or buildings by tag. The auto-tagging makes searching more powerful, since you can narrow results down by either type of tag. , offers similar search capability, though without explicitly showing you the tags. Both of those services also let you see a map of where the photo was taken (if it's geotagged, as most smartphone photos are now) and , camera data. Apple iCloud doesn't have any search, tagging, or EXIF display at all. You can share and tag photos yourself, too, in OneDrive, and the recipient doesn't have to sign into a Microsoft account unless you grant edit rights rather than just viewing.,When you share a video from OneDrive, the cloud service transcodes it on the fly using , to match the capabilities of the receiver's bandwidth. This way if you share to someone's phone, they won't download an unnecessarily large file that would be prone to pause the video for buffering. I tried sharing a video to a phone with just three bars of LTE connectivity, and my test movie played smoothly and clearly without interruption.,OneDrive's photo tricks also include optical character recognition (OCR) technology, which extracts text from images. If you save a photo with text in it to your cloud storage, the Info panel on its OneDrive page includes an extracted text area, which you can click to cut and paste anywhere. Google Drive's help talks about OCR, but it's not in the Drive interface. You need to open the image in Google Docs to get the functionality. You can forget about any OCR in iCloud, though Dropbox offers it to ,.,OneDrive also lets you edit photos, too, including cropping, rotation, lighting, and color adjustments. The tools are useful and easy to use. My only complaint is that the service is missing an auto-correct button, though it includes several effect filters with a slider for adjusting their strength. Note that editing only works with JPEG and PNG formats. When I tried using them in Android on an iPhone photo in HEIC format, I couldn't view the image in the editing interface, though most image formats display fine for mere viewing.,You can still find the UWP (Universal Windows Platform, or modern Microsoft Store app) version of OneDrive for Windows is somewhat redundant, not really offering much you can't do in File Explorer or on the website. It used to make sense as a share target in the standard UWP app Share panel, but that's no longer a thing. The app is a perfectly functional utility for viewing and uploading folders and files, and it looks good, especially in dark mode. I can also see how it would be useful for ,. A recent update adds easy account switching,,Any Windows app or web services can take advantage of OneDrive cloud storage, though. Microsoft has made it simple for developers. For example, , lets you open and save edited images to OneDrive.,Microsoft states that your OneDrive data is covered by ""advanced encryption, compliance, and other enterprise-grade security features."" The service supports multi-factor authentication, and has at-rest and in-transit encryption for all users and file types. It's not a , system, however, but the company doesn't allow staff standing access to data keys, According to its documentation, it ""maintains a 'zero-standing access' policy, which means that engineers do not have access to the service unless it is explicitly granted in response to a specific incident that requires elevation of access."" ,The company also proactively ,: ""OneDrive and Office 365 maintain robust, real-time security monitoring systems. Among other issues, these systems raise alerts for attempts to illicitly access customer data, or for attempts to illicitly transfer data out of our service."" After 15 years in operation, there have been no major breaches of OneDrive, so the track record does inspire confidence. If absolute privacy for your cloud files is your primary concern rather than convenience and features, check out ,.,Finally, OneDrive offers the Personal Vault, mentioned above, which requires extra authentication whenever you want to access its contents.,Microsoft's cloud solution has come together admirably in OneDrive, combining file syncing with cloud storage. Cross-platform support for Android, iOS, macOS, and Xbox devices is a smart move on Microsoft's part, too. That's not to say that there aren't other great choices out there. Fellow Editors' Choice winner , is also an excellent service, especially for those who are committed to Google's online ecosystem, and for its more generous 15GB free storage (though that space is shared with Gmail). , is another PCMag Editors' Choice winner, for its large feature set—especially when it comes to backup and archiving—and its low price.,OneDrive, however, was the first platform cloud service with on-demand desktop file storage for individuals. Its integration with Microsoft 365 and third-party apps, collaborative document editing, security options, strong photo tools, and wide platform support—including a top-notch web interface and productivity apps—earn Microsoft OneDrive a five-out-of-five rating and an Editors' Choice award for cloud storage and syncing.,For more on how to get the most out of the service, read ,.,OneDrive, the default online storage and syncing service for Windows and Microsoft 365, offers a wealth of powerful features, as well as apps for all major platforms.

Enpass Password Manager Review,"Secure syncing methods keep your passwords offline.,As a PCMag security analyst, I report on security solutions such as password managers and parental control software, as well as privacy tools such as VPNs. Each week I send out the , newsletter filled with online security news and tips for keeping you and your family safe on the internet. ,Enpass Password Manager can sync your passwords without uploading them to the cloud and handles the basics, but it doesn't support many multi-factor authentication methods and offers unsecured sharing options.,Getting locked out of an important site because you forgot your password is a pain, even when it offers a simple way to reset it. It's tempting just to use the same password everywhere, but it sets you up to be hacked. Use a , such as Enpass to create a unique, strong password for every site. ,A recent update adds an audit system to the password manager's vault to encourage proper password hygiene and introduces Enpass Business, an ,. Enpass can store your passwords locally, but if you want to sync between devices, you need to attach a cloud storage account or configure a Wi-Fi syncing option. Some may find this extra requirement to be confusing and inconvenient. ,A lack of expected multi-factor authentication options and limited sharing features are other drawbacks to this service. ,, one of our Editors' Choice picks, offers robust multi-factor authentication support, extensive sharing capabilities, and full password histories.,Enpass’s pricing structure is different than that of most competitors. Desktop users on Windows, macOS, and Linux devices can use the free Lite edition of Enpass. On those platforms, you get all of Enpass’ features and full syncing capabilities between desktop devices. There’s also a portable version you can run from a USB drive.,If you want to sync your passwords to a mobile device, you can do so for free with up to 10 items, which is a change from the previous limit of 25. If you go over those limits, you must subscribe to one of the paid Enpass plans. The Individual plan costs $23.99 per year or $15.99 every six months. With an individual plan, you can store and sync an unlimited number of vaults and entries across an unlimited number of devices. You also get security alerts of any website breaches. In addition, Enpass will identify any accounts in your vault that support multi-factor authentication. ,A family plan offers the same features for up to six users at $47.99 annually. Alternatively, you can pay a one-time fee of $79.99 to unlock all Enpass’s features for a single user permanently. ,'s Premium tier undercuts Enpass at just $10 per year. , Premium, Keeper (at the Personal Unlimited tier), and 1Password Premium all cost more, at $36, $34.99, and $35.88 per year, respectively. ,Other ,, including Editors’ Choice winner Bitwarden, do not restrict the number of vault entries you can sync across platforms. Bitwarden also syncs your passwords to the cloud for storage and syncing.,We downloaded Enpass from the company's website to get started. We primarily tested the Enpass app on a Windows 10 laptop and an iPhone 12 mini.,Download and install the desktop app, then set up an account by providing and confirming your email address. Next, create a master password, which encrypts all your data. This password should be , by anyone else. Enpass rates your master password and offers specific advice for improving a bad one—noting, for example, what you've typed contains a name or a common password. Your master password is irrecoverable, so make sure to write it down in a safe place.,From the setup screen, you can choose to install Enpass' browser extension, which is available for Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi. The web extensions need to be used in conjunction with the desktop apps and are required for password capture and replay. ,’s browser extensions can function independently, by contrast. We installed Enpass’ extensions in Chrome for testing.,You can also choose whether Enpass should check for compromised passwords from the setup screen. The way this works is that Enpass sends the first five characters of your encrypted passwords to haveibeenpwned.com ,. ,Getting all your passwords into a password manager is a significant investment of time. Therefore, , to another needs to be as seamless as possible. Fortunately, Enpass can import from over a dozen competitors, among them LastPass, RoboForm Everywhere, and Dashlane. It can also import from Chrome and other instances of Enpass.,If your old password manager isn't on the list, never fear. You can export from the old guard to a CSV file, format it to the file layout Enpass uses, and then import it. Enpass supports importing logins, credit cards, and secure notes.,When you set up your account, Enpass creates a primary , for password storage. You can create additional vaults, perhaps adding a separate one for work-related passwords. 1Password operates similarly. Apart from vaults, you can organize entries by creating tags and sub-tags.,Across the top of the desktop app interface, there’s a search bar, a plus icon for adding a new entry, a button for locking the application, an icon for the password generator, and a settings area. Oddly, the settings section appears in both the top bar and as an item under the application’s menu. Notable settings include the option to lock the application with a PIN, set up cloud syncing, create backup files of your passwords, generate pre-shared keys for securely sharing passwords, and customize the interface categories and templates. There’s also a dark theme option, which is always welcome.,Enpass uses the popular three-column layout. You select an item type in the left column, view items of that type in the middle column, and dig into details for the selected item in the right column, which also doubles as the display area for the password audit section. ,Enpass uses site-logo icons for popular sites and plugs in a generic icon for the rest. Going down the left-hand side of the interface, you see a list of all entry categories (such as logins, credit cards, identities, and notes), a Tags section, the Audits section, and an Others section. Items in the Others area include ,, Attachments, Archived, and Trashed.,To edit an item, select it from the middle column and then hit the pencil icon at the top of the left-most column. You can add custom fields and sections to each item as well as upload files.,Enpass handles storage differently than many password managers. Enpass keeps your passwords in local storage rather than maintaining servers to store your encrypted data in the cloud.,Local storage is fine if you only use Enpass on a single system. However, most people will want access to their passwords and other data from more locations. You can sync via a third-party cloud provider or a Wi-Fi connection.,To sync your passwords using a third-party , service, go to Settings > Vaults in the desktop app, select the vault you want to sync, and choose Set Up Sync. Then you need to give Enpass permission to set up a folder in your Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, , account. You can also use a shared network folder.,People who are new to the idea of password managers may not want to involve their cloud storage accounts in the process. If anything, storing passwords in a folder in a cloud storage account you use frequently makes the data more visible (and thus more likely to be accidentally deleted).,Enpass doesn’t offer some typical , options for its desktop app. Instead, Enpass reasons that since cloud providers offer multi-factor authentication, your synced data is secured that way. Enpass' mobile apps offer authentication via biometrics, such as a fingerprint or face scan.,In a company representative's , regarding why Enpass does not include the usual multi-factor options, they point users toward setting up a Keyfile, which allows you to access your passwords in addition to your master password. A Keyfile, thus, could function as a second factor. However, if you keep the Keyfile on the same device where your passwords are stored, this is not ideal. As such, we would like to see more mainstream multi-factor authentication options (such as via an , or ,) for protecting access to Enpass' desktop app. ,Wi-Fi Sync lets you sync your vaults across devices without involving a third-party cloud service. In essence, you set up your Enpass desktop app as a server for your vaults and let your other devices discover that server and sync the data. The server and your target devices must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network for this feature to work. The benefit of this setup is that your data never leaves your home network.,To set up Wi-Fi Sync, head to the desktop app's Settings, select Wi-Fi Sync, hit the Start button, and then select the vaults you want to sync. Enpass will generate a QR code you can scan with the mobile app (if you want to sync your vault with a mobile device, for example). Alternatively, you can follow the manual setup instructions. Both methods worked fine in testing. ,The Enpass desktop application stores and syncs your passwords and other personal data, but that's all it does. You must install the browser extensions if you want the expected password capture and replay. ,The Enpass web extension lists your logins, favorites, credit cards, and identities. You also get access to the password generator and a search bar for quickly finding items. Clicking on a login item fills that information in on a relevant page, and you can edit entries directly. ,The Enpass browser extension captures your username and password as you log in to each secure site. You can give the entry a descriptive name and apply tags.,We found that Enpass worked fine with Gmail’s two-page login. Enpass also had no issues with regular, single-page login prompts. ,Once you have all your passwords safely stored in the password manager, you're halfway secure. To finish the job, you need to replace all your bad passwords. Enpass’s Password Audit feature can help you identify those offending passwords. This tool is accessible via the left-hand menu of the desktop app.,The Password Audit section breaks down into five sections: Compromised, Weak, Identical, Breached, and 2FA Supported. The Compromised section checks if any of your passwords appear in the HaveIBeenPwned database. Enpass asks for your permission before checking your passwords against this list online. The Weak section includes passwords that don’t meet Enpass’s definition of a strong password, for example, if they are too short, not varied enough, or otherwise guessable. ,The Identical section lists passwords that are the same across accounts. The Breached section is very similar to the Compromised section in that it checks to see if your passwords appeared on a breach list on HaveIBeenPwned. The 2FA Supported section highlights accounts from sites that support multi-factor authentication.,Enpass, like every modern password manager, offers a password generator tool. By default, Enpass generates passphrases like the XKCD’s popular , example rather than random strings of characters. Passphrases are set to six words in length out of the box (but can go up to 15). Oddly, by Enpass’s own standards, this six-word length only rates as , rather than ,. Enpass should make its passphrase default option stronger.,You specify whether it uses uppercase letters and digits and the separator between the words. The stated reason to use passphrases is that they're both long and memorable. Even when you don't have to memorize them, longer is always better. ,To generate a more traditional password (random strings of numbers and letters), uncheck the Pronounceable toggle. For these passwords, Enpass defaults to 32 characters. You choose whether to include uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. ,If you need to generate a password that meets specific requirements, Enpass can do that too. You can restrict the generated password to a minimum or an exact number of uppercase letters, digits, and symbols, exclude certain characters, and avoid ambiguous characters such as the capital O and the digit 0.,Enpass can store various personal data and sync these important details across your devices. Options range from general address and contact data to credit cards and licenses. A collection of computer-related data templates includes details for databases, FTP servers, , systems, and more.,The Miscellaneous category includes over two dozen types of data, each with a template for storing the relevant information. These include national ID numbers for various regions of the world, vehicle info, clothing sizes, and even eyeglasses prescriptions.,You can also attach files and images to your vault entries. For example, you could add a photo of your driver's license to the corresponding item. Your storage space is limited to the amount left on your local device or in the cloud storage account you set up. Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault also emphasizes storing data in your digital vault, but you need to pay a fee for any serious storage capabilities. ,We don't normally advise sharing passwords, but ,. Sharing an Enpass password with another Enpass user is simple, though you must protect your security.,From the desktop app, you select Share from the menu (the one with three vertical dots) for that item. The program warns that items shared outside Enpass aren't encrypted—unless you've defined a , in Advanced Settings. The PSK is a password you create and send to the recipient or group before sending the password itself.,Enpass lets you limit shared fields by toggling off the Username and Password fields. It also offers the option to use one of the shared keys you created. To finish the share operation, you send the share via email or copy it to the clipboard and share another way.,You take a big chance if you don’t use a PSK. Enpass sends these credentials in plain text, followed by an encrypted block that you can copy into another instance of Enpass. ,We strongly advise you not to use the sharing feature without adding a PSK or sending the share data via an encrypted channel. Ideally, Enpass would not include an unsecured method for sharing at all.,As noted, LastPass and LogMeOnce also offer secure sharing. With these, you can share credentials while hiding the password itself from view, and you can also revoke sharing. When you share an item in Enpass, you can't revoke or modify the shared item; it's out of your hands.,Enpass does not currently offer any password inheritance features, which would facilitate the transfer of your credentials and other valuable information in the event of your untimely demise. Because Enpass primarily functions offline, there wouldn't necessarily be a way for it to facilitate such a transfer. Both LastPass and Keeper Password & Digital Vault support digital inheritance features. This is just one way to ,.,While Enpass doesn't use some of the traditional multi-factor authentication methods for its own protection, it can replace a third-party authenticator app such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator with supporting websites. It generates the necessary TOTPs internally and applies them automatically. ,You can use the Enpass mobile app to scan the QR code to set up this feature. Setting up TOTP with the Enpass desktop app is more of an adventure. Each saved item has an optional field titled One-time code that you fill in with a secret key. Log in to the TOTP-protected site and edit your multi-factor settings to obtain that key. Look for the alternative secret key option when you get to the QR code page. Copy that text string into the relevant item's TOTP field in Enpass and save. With 1Password’s desktop app, you can scan the QR code with a built-in tool, making the process much easier.,When you view the item in Enpass, you see the current value of the TOTP, along with a 30-second countdown until the key changes. LastPass goes one step further with TOTPs by backing them up, which is helpful if you accidentally delete your authenticator app.,Unless you pay for Enpass's Individual Plan, your mobile apps can only manage a single vault and the first ten entries you add. Most users will hit those limits quickly, so it’s not as workable a solution as other free password mobile managers, such as Bitwarden, which does not restrict you to a certain number of entries.,On iOS, you can enable Face ID or Touch ID authentication. It supports the Autofill feature on both platforms. Enpass lets you connect to your Apple Watch or Android Wear, too.,We installed Enpass on an iPhone 12 mini. The app is on par with the desktop version. You can access any vaults you’ve synced, manage tags, use all the password audit tools, and generate passwords. Auto-filling worked as expected in apps, as did filling TOTP codes. You can use the Enpass mobile app to scan QR codes to set up app-based multi-factor authentication methods.,In a recent update, Enpass unveiled its new enterprise password manager. As with the regular individual or family Enpass accounts, Enpass Business (starting at $2.99 per user per month) stores data locally on employee devices, with an option to use cloud storage. ,The app allows administrators to designate rules regarding employee vaults, security, sharing, syncing, and password audits. The app integrates with Microsoft 365, and employees can share vaults with team members using the default interfaces on OneDrive and SharePoint.,As with competitors NordPass and Dashlane, Enpass Business features an audit system for users and a security dashboard for administrators. The reporting dashboard shows which employees have weak, reused, or old passwords in their vaults.,One helpful feature of Enpass Business is automatic offboarding. It allows an administrator to automatically delete data from employee devices and vaults when they leave the organization. Competitor Bitwarden has a similar function: admin users can remove team members from vaults at their discretion.,Enpass Password Manager can sync passwords across all your Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops via a third-party cloud storage provider or a Wi-Fi connection. It handles password capture and form-filling as expected, too. Although we like that it can replace your authenticator app, Enpass needs to eliminate the unsecured sharing method, let users specify sharing permissions, and add inheritance options. Enpass's biggest flaw is its lack of mainstream multi-factor options.,, ,, and , are our Editors’ Choice picks for password managers because of their ease of use and excellent features. Our Editors' Choice winner for free password management is , since it is easy to use and doesn't impose syncing restrictions.,Enpass Password Manager can sync your passwords without uploading them to the cloud and handles the basics, but it doesn't support many multi-factor authentication methods and offers unsecured sharing options.,Sign up for , newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Thermaltake The Tower 500 Review,"A serious stand-up, show-off chassis for big boards,Years back, when a small website called out for product-review editors. I leapt at the opportunity: I’d just wrapped up a four-year stint as a systems supplier. That experience provided the credentials I’d need for the transition from industry supplier to industry observer. For one thing, I’d been the first source for an exposé on capacitor plague (,) at EDN. ,Want to show off every high-end PC component you just bought, but in a small desk footprint? If you have the skill and desire, you can fit it all inside Thermaltake's The Tower 500 for maximum visibility.,Twice as wide and the same height as the average Extended ATX (EATX) full tower, The Tower 500’s dimensions focus more on component visibility than component count. There isn’t, for example, any space for a second power supply or other unusual redundancies, but the space it has is instead devoted to providing a full-frontal view of a single motherboard that’s up to 13 by 13 inches in size. , that offer that level of component visibility usually run at a luxury price, but The Tower 500's $169.99 list price puts it on a level that's more in line with the average enthusiast chassis.,Around back, we find a large magnetic filter sheet covering an enormous rear panel vent, a full ATX power supply bay with dual mounting patterns to allow the power supply to be flipped if desired, and a slide-out dust filter for the power supply bay’s air inlet. Loosening two screws on the back panel allows it to be lifted off, while a gap above it allows the top panel to be pulled off. More than just a handhold, the top panel gap is also designed to allow cable egress.,Front-panel ports include four USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a single USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, and a pair of classic stereo jacks for a headphone and microphone. The power button is nearly surrounded by a glowing (blue) power-on indicator ring, save for a small segment near the top that flashes red to indicate hard drive activity.,Held down by the top panel, the upper panels of the front and sides slide upward off mounting slots to provide internal access. The sides are interchangeable and may be rotated to position ventilation holes at either the front or rear portion of the motherboard chamber.,Lower front and side panels are secured , the edge via thumbscrews, and removing these exposes the three sides of the power supply chamber.,Removing the entire outer shell adds to the proportional perspective: The motherboard is mounted several inches below the top of the case, pointing back-end-up, placing it at the focal center of a finished build.,Each of the two removable panels that separate the motherboard from the power supply chambers can hold a single 3.5-inch drive, two 2.5-inch drives, a single 120mm fan, or the two ends of an included triple-fan radiator bracket. Two screws at the front, and two tabs at the back, connect each cover plate to the front radiator bracket and motherboard tray, respectively.,Options become a little less decisive as we consider the possibilities, as removing a cover plate provides users access to a multi-pattern water-pump mounting point. Pumps with integrated reservoirs will protrude through the right cover plate’s location, preventing it from being installed. Since these cover plates are the lower mounting point of the included triple-fan radiator bracket, removing the right cover prevents the installation of a radiator on the case’s right side.,Flipping the front-panel radiator bracket allows it to draw air from the bottom-panel vent rather than the front panel. It also prevents the reinstallation of power-chamber cover plates, since the top of the bracket was formerly the forward mounting point for those, and also partly obscures the water-pump mounting point, though enough of it remains exposed that it will still likely fit most pump brackets.,A removable drive tray behind the motherboard tray holds two 120mm exhaust fans, while a removable power supply bracket sits beneath. Full-size power supplies of just about any length will fit, since the case’s default configuration provides 13 inches of space between this mounting flange and the front radiator support.,Included on the drive tray are two 120mm/140mm mounts that can each be repurposed to hold a single 3.5-inch drive, two lower cages that each hold a 3.5-inch drive, and two removable upper cages that each hold up to two 2.5-inch drives. The upper cages can also be replaced with 3.5-inch drives, allowing a total of six 3.5-inch drives, or four 3.5-inch drives and four 2.5-inch drives, or two 3.5-inch drives plus four 2.5-inch drives and two fans, behind the motherboard.,The Tower 500 offers its builders a far more flexible configuration than most cases, but using our simplified component set will at least allow us to compare its performance to lesser-equipped case models. Two of our components were provided by their manufacturers specifically for these tests: Corsair's iCue H100i RGB PRO XT CPU cooler serves both the CPU and its voltage regulator via proximity to the latter, while the long cables and PS2 adapter plate of FSP’s SFX-based Dagger Pro 850W power supply (model SDA2-850) lets us use the same component across cases of various size. Here's a full accounting of all the parts and software we used...,The Tower 500 includes a radiator bracket set designed to hold three 120mm fans (or a so-called 360mm radiator), a beep-code speaker for motherboard headers, a bag of #6-32 (UNC) screws for 3.5-inch drives and various devices, a bag of M3 screws for 2.5-inch drives and motherboard standoffs, a set of four screws for installing a power supply, three extra standoffs to support the leading edge of 13-inch-deep full-spec EATX motherboards, a manual, a sheet of adhesive foam washers for damping vibrations around 2.5-inch drive mounts (if you're still using hard drives there as opposed to SSDs), a bag of foam grommets for damping vibrations of 3.5-inch drives, and a pack of cable ties.,Front-panel cables are factory bundled into two sections to clear the motherboard hole...,The cable group on the Tower 500’s right side includes a USB 3 Gen 1 that feeds two Type-A ports, and an HD Audio cable that connects the headphone and microphone jacks.,With the cables connected, we can finally assess how our ATX components appear within the Tower 500’s confines: We see enough space beneath our motherboard’s forward edge that we could have installed a 12.8-inch motherboard, but installing a 13-inch-deep motherboard would have required us to give up the power supply's bay covers. Meanwhile, there’s enough space to the left of the board that a vintage XL-ATX motherboard would fit, but putting one there would complicate cable management.,Now, note that our test build would better reflect The Tower 500's use case if the parts were RGB lit. Designed to showcase components, The Tower 500 would have accomplished that task much better had we simply used components with more LEDs. But the test gear is the test gear!,From a design and implementation perspective, we’d expect The Tower 500 to perform somewhat closely to the , from Lian Li. While only around two degrees separates these two, the , wedges itself between them in CPU temperature. The Tower 500 maintains an acceptable temperature even as it suffers a slight loss here.,The Tower 500 falls further behind in voltage regulator temperature, and that’s ,because our AIO CPU cooler’s fans are a relatively great distance from it. Having noted this, even its losing temperature would be safe in environments far hotter than ours.,As for video card cooling, what the Tower 500 most likely needs is a couple of intake fans at the bottom simply to become competitive, but at least our GPU never got hot.,Our SPL meter showed that the Tower 500 was the second noisiest case in today’s comparison group, though the 1.6db delta between it and the Pop XL Silent will be barely noticeable to most people. ,In fact, while as-delivered performance wasn’t exciting, it was ordinary enough that we’d probably just add a couple of quiet fans to the intake to bump up the balance of any subsequent build.,All the performance talk begs the question, though: Would you even use The Tower 500 for any kind of regular PC build? Showing off is the Tower 500’s ,, and we aren’t building a show system in the immediate future with parts like we use in our test build; they'd be RGB-packed and chosen for looks as much as fine thermal performance. ,Show-system builders would be likely to do far more than add a couple of intake fans, and are more likely to see Thermaltake’s example build here , for what this case is designed to do. We’re thinking custom liquid-cooling loops, custom-bent hardline tubing, and pumps with gigantic top reservoirs as representatives of the true nature of its market. Still, even if all you want to do is max out on pre-lit RGB bits, like at the link, The Tower 500 delivers a fine ready-to-go palette for your painterly PC efforts. ,Want to show off every high-end PC component you just bought, but in a small desk footprint?

Ikea Vappeby Review,"A portable speaker with a modest glow,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,The build quality of the Ikea Vappeby Bluetooth speaker is in line with its budget price, but you won't find many other models that can legitimately function as a lamp.,The $69.99 Ikea Vappeby—like the company's , ($199)—does more than just play music; it's also a decent accent light. As a ,, it pumps out reasonably rich bass depth and offers useful Spotify Tap support. And, as an LED lamp, it's sufficiently bright and durable to accompany you on most outdoor trips. The primarily plastic build doesn’t inspire confidence, and we wish there were a companion app, but it's still a worthwhile purchase for people who value versatility above all else in their audio products. If you want a traditional speaker with more colorful lighting features, the , ($199.99) is a strong (though considerably pricier) choice with excellent sound. We’re also fans of the plainer, but budget-friendly and highly customizable, , ($39.99).,Although we're on board with the Darth Vader-like design, the Vappeby’s use of low-quality plastic is a little more difficult to support. It gives off some cheap-bird-feeder vibes at first glance, though simply turning on the light makes it look more sophisticated. It's quite light (roughly 4 pounds) for its size (10 inches high by 7 inches in diameter), and it's available in either a dark blue or gray finish.,It's simple to install the speaker's handle with the included hex key and four screws, but it seems like an oversight that it doesn't pivot or slide down. The long USB-A-to-USB-C charging cable in the package connects to a recessed USB-C panel on the bottom of the unit and snaps into a canal cutout for stability. Meanwhile, rubber feet on the base keep the device from shifting around on flat surfaces. ,There are three controls at the speaker’s base. Pressing the left button for three seconds turns it on or off, while holding down the right one initiates Bluetooth pairing. The middle button controls the lamp: One tap turns it on at full brightness, another dims it slightly, and a third turns it off. The buttons work well, but we're a bit disappointed about the lack of track-navigation controls. There’s no mic, either, so you can't use the device as a speakerphone or to summon a voice assistant.,The speaker's LED element sits under the hood of the mushroom-like cap and faces down. It surrounds the system's single driver like a ring. The driver fires straight down into a contoured plastic exterior that vaguely resembles the bottom half of an hourglass; the shape helps disperse the audio in every direction. We don't have any information about driver size or Bluetooth , support, but you likely shouldn't buy this speaker if those aspects are vital to your buying decision.,The Vappeby’s , might initially seem impressive, but you shouldn't treat the speaker as if it's indestructible. The first digit (6) means it is dustproof, but the second (5) translates to just a mild level of water resistance. It can withstand relatively low-pressure water jets from any direction, but you can't submerge it or rinse it off under a faucet without risking damage. Most of the , we test are actually waterproof, so one of those models is a better fit for rougher adventures.,Ikea estimates the speaker's 3,300mAh lithium-ion battery can last roughly between 11 and 13 hours per charge, assuming a middle-level volume and a dim light setting. Those figures are sure to decrease if you turn up the volume substantially or frequently leave the brightest lamp setting active. ,As mentioned, the Vappeby doesn't come with an app (and thus there's no , option), but it does offer Spotify Tap functionality. If you have an account with that ,, simply press the power button once to hear a curated music playlist.,The Vappeby works better as an accent light than as a major source of illumination for reading or other tasks. That's partly because of the thick plastic shade and downward-firing LED. If the plastic were a bit more transparent and the LEDs faced outward or upward, it would fare better here. But, as is, the device provides only a warm glow at its brightest setting. We still think the effect looks cool, however; it's as if the speaker is sitting in the center of a spotlight. It's a much more elegant look than the typically chaotic LED light shows you get with some other models.,Outdoors, it can provide some (but not a massive amount) of background light for a tent or campsite, though it also might just end up attracting light-sensitive bugs instead. (Perhaps a Zappeby model is in the works?),On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” the speaker delivers an average sense of bass depth at moderate volumes. The track doesn't turn into a distorted mess at top volumes (as we might expect from a speaker this size and price), but some audio artifacts crept into the mix and indicated that the sole driver was at its limits.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, better reveals its general sound signature. Even on this track, you get some sense of the lows: The drums sound full and heavy, while a thumping vibration becomes palpable at full volumes. The low-mids and mids match well with the higher frequencies, and the result is a rich, somewhat crisp mix. At lower volumes, the bass presence is more difficult to hear, but the speaker still produces clean, balanced audio.,On the hip-hop track “No Church in the Wild,” the kick-drum loop receives enough high-mid presence for its attack to retain some punch, but it’s a tad duller than typical. The loop gets some additional thump, though the sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat aren't quite fully present—as we expected, we hear just their raspy top notes. The device still delivers a decent sense of bass depth, but it’s just more evident in the loop’s sustain than in the deeper elements. The vocals on this track sound crisp and generally free of sibilance.,Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, sound rich and pleasantly balanced. There's a little less detail in the higher-register brass, strings, and vocals than we prefer, but those elements are still sufficiently clear.,Despite its modest price, the Ikea Vappeby speaker largely delivers on its two primary functions—it produces better-than-expected Bluetooth audio and works decently well as a lamp. A higher IP rating, onboard track-navigation controls, and a companion app would all add value, but those downsides are not deal breakers. ,In addition to the Tribit and Anker models we mentioned above, we’re also fans of the , ($179.95), which offers more powerful audio from a truly waterproof shell. Just know that none of these other options is quite as unique or functional as Ikea's latest.,The build quality of the Ikea Vappeby Bluetooth speaker is in line with its budget price, but you won't find many other models that can legitimately function as a lamp.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Cooler Master MasterBox 520 Mesh Review,"ARGB fans highlight an airy tower chassis,Years back, when a small website called out for product-review editors. I leapt at the opportunity: I’d just wrapped up a four-year stint as a systems supplier. That experience provided the credentials I’d need for the transition from industry supplier to industry observer. For one thing, I’d been the first source for an exposé on capacitor plague (,) at EDN. ,Cooler Master's proven MasterBox 520 design gets updated to USB-C and ARGB to deliver a free-flowing, attractive tower chassis.,With roughly 20 years of , manufacturing experience, Cooler Master proves its skill at mass-producing moderately priced quality once again in its MasterBox 520 Mesh ($129.99). Smooth edges, tight gaps, and superb finishes are found throughout, and the firm even designed a glass side-panel system that reduces the likelihood of builders dropping this somewhat fragile piece during hardware installation or maintenance. Updates for this model include a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C front-panel port, ARGB fans, an integrated ARGB controller, and a mesh face panel to show off those ARGB fans. It's a quality chassis for enthusiasts who favor airflow and RGB glow.,The biggest thing that may curtail the MasterBox 520 Mesh’s efforts to bridge the premium case market may be its paucity of ports, but another thing that might bother buyers willing to pay more than $120 for a case is that this one doesn’t have a true dust filter for all those fans. It instead collects dust within the holes of its mesh face panel inserts, which could make cleaning a frequent and cumbersome task (depending on your environment). ,While this problem isn’t unique to the MasterBox 520 Mesh, it becomes more noteworthy in a case market that used to pay extra to , admire its own dust: Premium cases of a few years ago typically had a washable filter hidden behind an opaque front panel. Attached to a painted frame, the MasterBox 520 Mesh’s vents should only be cleaned with compressed air. It’s not that the MasterBox 520 Mesh lacks any washable dust filters, as the power supply filter is definitely a nylon-on-plastic arrangement that isn’t easily discolored by this form of cleaning. It’s just that Cooler Master appears to have been forced by the demands of ARGB fans (the spinning things, , the enthusiasts, pun intended) to disregard such niceties for the case’s front.,The paucity of ports points to a design update in which one Type-A port is replaced with a Type-C, without retooling the face panel to fit the smaller port. The result is that the Type-A port sits solitary on a motherboard header that’s designed for two ports. This is why competing cases usually have two Type-A ports, plus a single Type-C.,A perforated sheet with magnetic strips under its edge covers the top, and removing it reveals a top mount that fits the same selection of fans as the front: three 120mm or two 140mm parts, including so-called 360mm and 280mm radiator/fan combos.,The MasterBox 520 Mesh’s lid can be flipped up and lifted off after the simple removal of two screws, which should help those who build with top-mounted liquid cooling systems to reach those cable-access holes at the top of the motherboard tray. Cooler Master rates this space as supporting radiators up to 55mm thick, but most builders will be better off considering that measurement the maximum thickness for their , cooler, including the radiator and fans. We measured 57mm vertical clearance, and advanced users who want to hang their fans below the motherboard’s top edge will find a bit more than 35mm of horizontal offset between the motherboard’s surface and a 120mm fan.,Seven removable expansion slots with no separators allow show-system builders to fit vertical expansion slot adapters without cutting. Extra-long slots on both sides of the empty rear fan mount allow vertical adjustment of any added part.,The sheet metal (steel) right side opens to reveal two 2.5-inch drive mounts on the back of the motherboard tray, and a 3.5-inch drive cage within the power supply tunnel that also holds a 2.5-inch drive on its top surface. The drive cage sits a bit over 235mm from the power supply's mounting surface, yet Cooler Master still rates this space as supporting power supplies only up to 200mm long. Space between the drive cage and front panel matches a 3-inch-deep gap in the power supply tunnel that’s designed to fit radiators and/or an additional layer of fans.,The MasterBox 520 Mesh ARGB controller features an integrated fan hub that supports up to four fans and five ARGB devices. Powered by a SATA drive power connector and featured with both fan and external ARGB input for optional motherboard control, Cooler Master repurposes the case’s front-panel reset button to act as a selector switch for the controller’s integrated lighting modes.,In addition to motherboard and power supply screws and standoffs, the installation kit includes mounting pins for 2.5-inch drives and mounting rails for 3.5-inch drives. While the rails engage directly with the lower drive cage in a traditional manner, the 2.5-inch drive mount requires users to install grommets into each drive mount hole and corresponding pins to each drive before pushing the drive pins into the grommets.,Cables include a power button and a front-panel LED indicator group, HD Audio for the front-panel headset (headphone/microphone combo) jack, a two-port USB 3.x Gen 1 cable that (as mentioned) leads only to a single Type-A port, a single-port Gen 2 cable that leads to a Type-C port, a SATA-style power for the ARGB controller/fan hub, an ARGB input (for motherboard control of that feature), and a fan-input cable for motherboard control of the unit’s passive fan-hub function.,While the MasterBox 520 Mesh’s motherboard tray is wide enough to fit nearly any motherboard, a subtle inward bend that starts just behind the grommeted cable-passage holes and ends just in front of those holes could cause the circuits of some deeper-than-ATX boards to make contact. Corsair rates the case as supporting motherboards up to 10.7 inches deep, and our standard 9.6-inch-deep model fits within the flat area.,Aside from any minor variations in component lighting, this is the view that welcomes builders to their freshly assembled MasterBox 520 Mesh PC.,Here’s a recap of our test build’s component loadout…,Lower is better of course when it comes temperature: In a comparison of similarly sized undamped cases, the MasterBox 520 Mesh took second place behind the , in CPU cooling, leaving two competitors behind (,, and ,).,As our motherboard’s CPU voltage regulator is cooled primarily by the CPU cooler’s fans, the MasterBox 520 Mesh’s design is as well-matched to our hardware’s design as the tied-in-temperature NZXT H7 Flow.,How the H7 Flow outmatched the MasterBox 520 Mesh in GPU temperature is slightly beyond obvious, though the presence of cooler air in the GPU area may have something to do with the design of its perforated power supply shroud. Please feel free to comment about our finding if you opt for this case; we'd like to know what you see.,One metric in which the MasterBox 520 Mesh handily beats the NZXT H7 Flow is in noise level, where flow has at least 1dB greater SPL. That’s not a big difference, but its ability to offset a minor loss for the MasterBox 520 Mesh in GPU temperature works to show how closely matched these two are in overall performance.,The performance match is a great thing since the NZXT H7 Flow, where available and in white, is currently priced at the same level as the MasterBox 520 Mesh. The Mesh offers triple ARGB fans and its own controller, while the Flow offers users…that second Type-A port that Cooler Master almost inexplicably lopped off the 520 Mesh. As there’s no clear leader, we suggest you pick yours based upon whichever feature you find to be most compelling...and which look you like better.

Google Nest Wifi Pro Review,"A stylish, basic Wi-Fi 6E router,I’ve been working with computers for ages, starting with a multi-year stint in purchasing for a major IBM reseller in New York City before eventually landing at PCMag (back when it was still in print as ,). I spent more than 14 years on staff, most recently as the director of operations for PC Labs, before hitting the freelance circuit as a contributing editor. ,Google's Nest Wifi Pro is a good-looking Wi-Fi 6E mesh router that's simple to set up and use, but its features and settings are limited.,Google's latest mesh router, the Nest Wifi Pro ($199.99), is a , that uses the relatively uncrowded 6GHz radio band and offers support for emerging wireless technologies including the smart home device standards Thread and Matter. Like earlier Nest routers, it's tastefully designed and easy to install, though we were disappointed to find the 6GHz radio band does not have its own SSID. The router posted respectable scores in our performance testing, but you'll get faster throughput, multi-gig networking, and direct access to the 6GHz band SSID with our Editors' Choice pick among Wi-Fi 6E mesh routers, the ,.,For our review, Google sent a single Nest Wifi Pro router, which provides up to 2,200 square feet of coverage. For larger homes, you can buy a two-pack ($299.99) or three-pack ($399.99), covering 4,400 or 6,600 square feet, respectively. Each router measures 5.1 by 4.6 by 3.3 inches (HWD) and is designed to be placed out in the open on a table or bookshelf, instead of hidden away in a corner, or on the floor. Color choices include Snow (white), Linen (off-white), Lemongrass (yellow), and Fog (light green).,You won't find any buttons on the router, though a small LED indicator on the front flashes white during startup, blue during setup, and yellow when the internet connection is lost. (It's solid white when fully connected.) Around back are two 1Gbps Ethernet ports, one used for WAN connectivity; the second can be used as a LAN port or for wired backhaul between nodes. Unlike the Eero Pro 6E, the Nest Wifi Pro does not have any multi-gig networking ports. Nor does the Google router have any USB ports for sharing storage devices, though to be fair, low-profile mesh systems rarely offer USB connectivity.,As a Wi-Fi 6E mesh router, the Nest Wifi Pro can transmit on the 6GHz radio band as well as the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio bands. It supports Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) data transmissions, WPA3 encryption, MU-MIMO simultaneous data streaming, direct-to-client signal beamforming, and 160MHz channel transmissions. It also features built-in support for ,, an emerging protocol for connecting IoT devices such as smart thermostats and lights, and ,, a connectivity standard designed to provide compatibility between smart home devices regardless of brand.,The router is powered by a dual-core ARM processor with 1GB of RAM and 4GB of flash memory. It's an AX5400 device that can hit maximum speeds of 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 2,400Mbps on the 5GHz or 6GHz band. Although it supports 6GHz radio transmissions, as mentioned earlier, there's no dedicated SSID for connecting devices directly to the 6GHz band. Band selection is handled automatically using band-steering technology.,Controlled using the Google Home app, the router appears in a panel under whichever room you assigned it to during setup. When you tap the panel, a pop-up screen tells you the Nest Wifi Pro's status (online and connected, or offline and disconnected), but it doesn't tell you if any clients are connected. A Run Speed Test button near the bottom of the screen lets you measure internet upload and download speeds, while a gear icon at upper right takes you to a Device Settings screen.,Settings are limited. A Preferred Activities tab lets you optimize the router for video calling and gaming, but it lacks options for assigning bandwidth priority to specific clients or applications. Wi-Fi settings are limited to enabling WPA3 encryption and 160MHz channel transmissions. You do get some parental controls, dubbed Family Wi-Fi, that let you apply Restricted Access rules to groups of devices using Google's SafeSearch filtering technology to automatically block access to websites containing adult content. However, you don't get the age-based parental control filters and anti-malware software tools that you get with the , mesh system. ,Other settings enable you to create a guest network, toggle privacy settings, and configure notifications that tell you when a new device has joined the network or Wi-Fi connectivity is lost. Advanced settings let you enable UPnP and IPv6, configure DNS settings, choose a WAN connection (DHCP, Static, PPOE), change LAN settings (IP address or subnet mask), and manage port forwarding rules.,Installing the Nest Wifi Pro couldn't be simpler. If you don't have the Google Home app, you'll have to install it and create an account. I started by plugging in the router and tapped ""Set up Nest Wifi router"" on the Home screen.,After a few seconds, the router was recognized. I then tapped Next and used my phone's camera to scan the QR code on the bottom of the device, and clicked Yes when asked to join the network; the router was immediately connected. I created a Wi-Fi network name and password, gave the router a location in my Home, and waited a few seconds for the network to be created. The router took a few minutes to restart, and the installation was complete.,Since you can't disable band steering, our throughput performance test results relied on the router's ability to select the optimal band and do not include separate 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz scores. I was able to verify that my test device, a ,, was connected to the 6GHz band during my tests, in which the Nest Wifi Pro turned in very respectable results.,In our close-proximity test (conducted within five feet of the router), I clocked the Google router at 909Mbps. That edged the , and TP-Link XE75 Pro (900Mbps each), but trailed the , (918Mbps) and the Eero Pro 6E (922Mbps). In the 30-foot test, the Nest Wifi Pro matched the Motorola's throughput of 372Mbps, unnoticeably faster than the TP-Link and Asus (371Mbps each). The Eero Pro 6E led the pack with 375Mbps., signal strength using an , Sidekick Wi-Fi diagnostic device and the Ekahau Survey mobile app to generate a heat map that shows a router's signal strength throughout our test home. (Disclosure: Ekahau is owned by PCMag's parent company, Ziff Davis.) The circle on the map represents the location of the router and the colors represent signal strength—dark green for the strongest signal, yellow for a weaker one, and gray for no measurable reception. These tests reflect a combined signal with the router selecting the appropriate band as I moved throughout the house.,As shown on the map above, the Nest Wifi Pro provided a strong signal to the central area of the house, but was weaker in the rooms farthest from the router and in the garage. In fairness, we usually review mesh systems with two or three nodes, so it's safe to say that a secondary node here would deliver a much stronger signal to the yellow areas.,If you're looking to upgrade your home network and want a mesh system that supports the latest smart home technologies, the Google Nest Wifi Pro is a solid choice. It's a tri-band Wi-Fi 6E router, which means it can take advantage of the fast and uncrowded 6GHz radio band, and it supports emerging wireless tech like Matter and Thread. ,Though the Nest is a strong performer, the Eero Pro 6E keeps our Editors' Choice award thanks to its slightly faster performance, multi-gig connectivity, and the option to connect directly to the 6GHz SSID.,Google's Nest Wifi Pro is a good-looking Wi-Fi 6E mesh router that's simple to set up and use, but its features and settings are limited.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Proton Drive Review,"Excellent security, not a lot of convenience,If security and privacy are your main concern in a cloud storage app, Proton Drive is the best choice. But that peace of mind comes at a price.,Proton's whole concept is providing secure, private alternatives to common web services, and its , service Proton Drive is the latest example. Proton is better known for its email service, ,, which is fully encrypted and has no privacy-invading ads. Its VPN service, ,, has one of the strongest privacy stances on the market. Proton Drive promises to deliver the same privacy and security that Proton users have come to know in those other products.,No one at Proton, the company, can access files you upload to Proton Drive—they're fully encrypted before you upload. That comes at a cost, both in terms of price and upload speeds. Still, if privacy is what you value most, then Proton Drive should be the first service you try out. If not, try Editors' Choice winners ,, ,, and ,.,Proton Drive's free account offers 500MB of storage with the chance to get 500MB more by doing a few simple tasks, such as uploading a file and creating a link to a shared file, for a total of 1GB. This is less generous than the free accounts offered by other cloud storage services. Microsoft OneDrive, IDrive, and , all offer 5GB for free, while Google Drive comes with 15GB of storage, though it's shared with Gmail. ,Paid plans start at $4.99 per month or $47.88 per year for Drive Plus, which includes 200GB of storage space. The most storage you can get is 500GB as part of Proton Unlimited, which costs $11.99 per month or $119.88 per year. Proton Unlimited also includes access to ProtonMail, Proton Calendar, and Proton VPN, and the storage space is shared with ProtonMail. ,These rates are considerably more expensive per GB than most of the competition, which across the board doesn't even offer plans with so little space. ,, which adds storage space to individual Google Drive accounts, charges $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year for 2TB of storage. , also charges $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage. Microsoft charges $99.99 per year for Microsoft 365 Family, which in addition to offering 1TB of storage each to 6 users—for a total of 6TB—also includes office apps like Word, Excel, and Outlook. IDrive has one of the best deals around: $79.40 per year for 5TB, meaning it's cheaper per GB than Proton Drive Plus while offering 25 times the storage space.,Proton Drive cannot even come close to competing with any of these companies in terms of price per GB. However, Proton's aim isn't to win on price. It's to provide an alternative to these other cloud storage services built around privacy and security first.,Proton Drive's core feature is security. Files are encrypted before being uploaded to Proton Drive, and the encryption keys are generated on your device. This means the company itself doesn't have access to your files, which also means that any hacker who breaks into the Proton Drive server (or any individual who has access to said server) can't view your files or even see the filenames.,You can read more about , on its website, but the summary is that everything is truly locked down. Proton also likes to point out that the company is headquartered in Switzerland and therefore is protected by that country's strong privacy laws. Proton customers have legal protections in Switzerland that prevent law enforcement from requesting access to your data without going through the courts first. If security and privacy are your top priority, Proton Drive makes a compelling case. None of the other services we've reviewed lock down information to this extent, though IDrive and Sync have an option to enable private encryption keys.,If you want to keep your account as private as possible, you can pay for it in cash by sending dollars, euros, or Swiss francs to the company at a mailing address provided on the website. You can upgrade an account using Bitcoin, but you aren't currently able to start a paid account with cryptocurrency.,Proton Drive primarily runs in the web browser. The company recommends using a , such as Firefox, Brave, or Tor, though Proton Drive is also compatible with more ,, including Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. ,Proton Drive offers ,, iPad, and ,, but there are no desktop apps as of this writing. The company told us support for Windows, macOS, and Linux is coming in 2023. ,Before you can use Proton Drive you must sign up for an account. If you're already a Proton Mail or Proton VPN user, you can use that account for Proton Drive. Otherwise you need to sign up and choose your plan. Note that you do not need to enter payment details if you opt for the free version. ,Next, you choose a username, which will double as your email address if you decide to use ProtonMail. Then you create a password and provide some recovery details. Finally, the app asks you to choose a color scheme for the web version of the app.,You can start uploading files immediately, either by dragging them to your browser or by clicking New Upload. You can upload individual files or an entire folder. Files you upload are encrypted in your browser before being uploaded to Proton's servers. ,ProtonDrive has no support for editing files in the browser. If you want to edit anything, you have to download the file, edit it, and then re-upload it. Since you can't edit in the browser, you also can't collaboratively edit, the way you can with ,, OneDrive, Google Drive, and other cloud storage services. Perhaps when the desktop version of Proton Drive is released collaborative editing or commenting on files will be possible, but for now it's not. ,Another limitation is preview functionality. You get previews for images, videos, and PDFs, but not proprietary formats like Microsoft Office documents. ,Proton Drive makes it easy to share files or even entire folders, all without decrypting the files. Right-click any file or folder and select Create link to get a link you can copy and paste to share the item. Optional settings allow you to add a password and set an expiration date.,Anyone you send the link to has to wait for the files to download and decrypt before they can see them. Needless to say, the recipient doesn't get any kind of preview before downloading the files.,Every major cloud storage service offers this kind of sharing functionality, where you can copy a link and give it to anyone. The setup is flexible because it doesn't require the recipient to use Proton Drive or any Proton products to get files.,What you can't do is share folders with other Proton users in a way that puts a synced version of the folder directly in their Drive. This limitation is likely due to the encrypted nature of the service, but it's disappointing nonetheless. Sharing folders directly on services like , and , is what makes them useful for collaborating. Proton Drive can't offer that kind of collaboration.,Proton Drive recently released a mobile app, which I tested on an iPad. It's useful for both browsing files you already uploaded and uploading files directly. You have the option to sync any files or folders to be available on your device offline. It's also possible to lock down access to the application using either a PIN or biometric tools like a fingerprint scanner or FaceID. ,One big disappointment, however, is there's currently no support for automatically backing up photos to the service, meaning you have to do it manually. OneDrive, iDrive, Google Drive, ,, among others, all have an option to automatically back up photos and videos from your mobile devices. I hope Proton adds this eventually. ,Proton Drive encrypts all files before uploading them, which makes it slower than other cloud services. My testing bore this out.,I uploaded 463GB of data from the same Windows 10 computer I use to test other cloud storage services. The process took 2 days, 15 hours, and 47 min, which works out to 1GB every 8 minutes and 16 seconds. It was quite a bit slower than almost every other service I've tested. Dropbox, the fastest app I tested, uploaded 1GB in 2 minutes and 56 seconds on average. iDrive took an average of 3 minutes and 24 seconds. Even Sync, one of the slower apps I tested, took an average of 5 minutes and 31 seconds. So Proton Drive is not particularly speedy.,For context, the Windows 10 computer I use has a mechanical hard drive attached to my local network via Ethernet. My home internet upload speed is 50Mbps. The CPU is not particularly powerful, which may be why the uploads took so long. You may experience significantly faster uploads if you have a high-end processor. I also live outside Portland, Oregon, on the US west coast, quite far from Proton's servers in Europe, which is likely also a factor. Your speeds will vary.,Proton has been deliberate about the rollout of its relatively new storage service, and we're optimistic that many of its shortcomings will eventually be addressed. If you prioritize security and privacy, these shortcomings are minor when weighed against Proton Drive's advantages. Privacy advocates and security professionals should be very excited that there's now a cloud storage option that shares their priorities.,For everyone else, though, Proton Drive is hard to recommend. It costs a lot more than PCMag's Editors' Choices winners ,, ,, and ,, while also offering a lot less functionality and storage space. So for now, only those who prioritize security and privacy above all else should consider Proton Drive.,If security and privacy are your main concern in a cloud storage app, Proton Drive is the best choice.

SSL Connex Review,"A crafty consumer-level mic from SSL,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,Although the compact SSL Connex USB mic is useful for conference calls and recording vocals, its main advantage is an immersive recording mode that simultaneously captures audio from its four condensers.,Solid State Logic (SSL) specializes in professional (and expensive) recording equipment for studios, so the $149.99 Connex , is a bit out of left field. We’re always eager to find out more when one of the pro audio stalwarts dips a toe into the consumer segment, however, and this device proved a very versatile tool for music recordings and conference calls in testing. It’s compact and easy to use, producing clear sound and offering useful recording modes for a variety of scenarios. We would prefer a discrete headphone knob instead of the onboard volume buttons, but that’s a relatively minor complaint in light of the mic's features. If you want a more straightforward recording tool, however, consider alternatives like the , ($129.99), which has better onboard controls.,At a size of 3.5 by 3.5 by 1.6 inches (HWD) and a weight of 10.6 ounces, the Connex is easy to store in a tote and just forget about. The bottom of the mic is pyramidal, though the top is flat. That top panel features the SSL logo, as well as capacitive plus and minus buttons. The four grilles along the sides resemble fine cheese graters because of their pattern of small perforations. A mic capsule aims outward behind each grille, and all four have a cardioid recording pattern. We discuss how they all work together in the next section.,The front panel (the side that faces you when the logo is right side up) has a recessed 3.5mm headphone jack, while the opposite panel has a recessed USB-C connector. The flat base has a rubber coating that keeps the unit stable, but there’s also a 1/4-inch threaded base and a thread adapter for use with mic stands or even camera tripods. The included USB Type-C cable is of generous length, at 6.5 feet, and ships alongside a USB Type-A adapter for those who need it.,The controls are mostly intuitive. For instance, you simply tap the SSL logo to toggle the mic on or off. In mute mode (when the logo is red), you can press and hold the logo to temporarily unmute the mic—when you lift your finger, you’re back in mute mode. The same applies when the mic is live (the logo should be green); press and hold the logo to temporarily mute yourself. ,The plus and minus buttons adjust headphone volume, as well as loopback volume (how much of the mic signal goes into the headphone signal). We understand that SSL is trying to keep the design clean here, but we would prefer a more graceful solution for controlling the levels, complete with a visual indicator. As is, the clearest indicator of volume is the red headphone icon that appears when you decrease the levels all the way. Yes, the , (DSP) pretty much handles all the work of normalizing source volume, but we hope SSL's next entry allows for a bit more control.,You hold both the plus and minus buttons for two seconds to put the mic into setup mode. (When you do, the SSL logo should begin to pulse.) Then, you can choose among several modes: The logo color turns white for Solo mode, green for Group mode, pink for Vocal mode, and blue for Music mode. (We explain these modes in more detail in the next section.),The Connex works with systems that run either at least macOS 10.4 or Windows 10. It supports up to 24-bit/96KHz recordings.,The Connex has four recording modes: Solo, Group, Vocal, and Music. Solo is by far the simplest and the one you should use for video meetings in which only one person is speaking at a time. In this dual mono mode, the mic accepts audio from the front capsule only, and the DSP prioritizes speech.,Group mode (also dual mono) works for video meetings and conference calls, as well, but is ideal for groups of people around a conference table. In this mode, the four capsules are all active, but the mic automatically mixes everything down to a mono signal in real time. Again, the DSP emphasizes speech intelligibility.,Vocal mode is ideal for music demos or narration—a singer at a piano or with an acoustic guitar is one example. All four capsules are active, but the device mixes the inputs down to a stereo signal. The focus remains on the front mic, while the other three capture the sonic nuances of the environment. The DSP here focuses on the softer signals that come into play with some styles of singing or narration.,Music mode is very similar to Vocal mode in how it utilizes the capsules. Again, the front mic is the primary, while the three other capsules pitch in to provide a stereo image. The DSP here is the difference; it's capable of handling louder sound sources, such as when several musicians are sitting around the mic. Because the front panel is dominant in the mix, however, it makes sense to position the singer or main soloist so that they face this mic during sessions.,Additionally, you can use the Immersive setting with each of the above modes. With this option, the quad-mic array sends individual tracks to your ,, thus enabling stereo or even surround mixes. This capability differentiates the Connex from the many competing models with variable polar patterns in this segment. ,To activate the Immersive mode, press and hold the SSL logo for five seconds when the device is in setup mode. (The logo should turn yellow.) You exit this mode the same way you enable it. That's important to note because the mic remains in this mode until you exit it (even after a restart). Windows users need to download additional drivers to use this feature.,With the Immersive setting active, channels one and two are either stereo or mono signals, depending on which recording mode you select. Channels three through six send discrete, solo signals through the USB connection (three is the front capsule, four is the rear capsule, and five and six are the left/ride stereo side capsules). ,Aside from the post-recording flexibility it unlocks, the Immersive mode also gives you access to DSP-free signals from inputs three through six. As such, you can use these extra channels to give your mix a little more spatial depth or to trigger effects. These channels are also useful for creating safety tracks and mixing in a surround sound studio environment.,Despite the SSL pedigree, any audio engineer can immediately identify this mic as more of an on-the-go capture tool, rather than a pro-level mic for studio recordings because of its heavy reliance on DSP. That said, it's fully up to tasks in a home or office setting.,In Solo mode, the mic delivered crisp vocals with even dynamics and avoided an overwhelming amount of dynamic compression. Group mode sounded a little less ideal because vocals can sound different depending on a source's relative position to the device, but the audio still sounded clear. We had no trouble hearing speakers who were directly in front of the capsules, but anyone at an off-angle didn't come through quite as loudly. The signal had the most volume in Vocal mode. Again, however, positioning plays a huge role in how much of a surround effect you get with recordings.,We didn't have any problem recording in the Immersive mode after setting up four additional tracks in ,. Some of these DSP-free tracks were much quieter than others when we were recording a single sound source, but that shouldn't be an issue if you position multiple sound sources around the mic. A way to adjust the gain for each track would be helpful here.,The SSL Connex’s quad-capsule condenser array isn’t typical, but the mic offers a unique recording experience that is useful in conference rooms, home studios, and on the go. Its standout feature is an Immersive mode that lets you record four discrete signals simultaneously (with no DSP) over a single USB connection. That’s handy for field recordings and films with surround sound, especially because of the unit’s convenient size. And in the regular recording modes, we’re fans of the clean audio tracks it produces and the DSP that prioritizes vocal clarity. ,Not everyone needs this level of versatility, however. If you want a more traditional USB mic for around $150, we recommend the DSP-free , ($169.99) in addition to the aforementioned MSI Immerse GV60. The Editors' Choice-winning , ($99.99) is another top option for podcasters and streamers.,Although the compact SSL Connex USB mic is useful for conference calls and recording vocals, its main advantage is an immersive recording mode that simultaneously captures audio from its four condensers.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

JVC HA-A9T Review,"Sub-$50 earbuds that get plenty right,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,Although they don't feel very premium, the water-resistant JVC HA-A9T earphones still impress with a punchy (but balanced) sound signature.,The JVC HA-A9T , (or Riptidz, depending on whether you believe the website or the box) are a bargain for $39.95. The water-resistant earbuds pair an impressive amount of bass depth with bright, sculpted highs, plus offer good battery life. We’re a bit disappointed that JVC doesn’t offer a companion app for them, but we can look past that omission at this price. The Editors' Choice-winning , ($35.99) don’t include a companion app either, but they offer other advantages such as a substantially better waterproof rating and support for the AAC codec.,Available in green, blue, or gray (with black accents) or white (with gray accents), the in-canal earphones have a stem-style design. They ship with three pairs of silicone eartips and fit quite securely. That said, we're not fans of their cheap plastic look. Even the less expensive , earphones look a little classier, though their underwhelming sound quality prevents us from recommending them. We’ll take the less stylish pair that sounds better any day. ,Speaking of sound quality, 6mm neodymium dynamic drivers deliver a frequency range of 20Hz to 20KHz with an impedance of 16 ohms. They are compatible with Bluetooth 5.1 and use the SBC ,. We don't necessarily expect support for either the AAC or AptX codecs in this segment, but it’s not uncommon to get at least one of them.,On-ear capacitive touch panels handle the basic controls. A single tap on either earbud controls playback and calls. A double tap on the left earpiece lowers the volume, while the same gesture on the right earpiece skips forward a track. Triple taps either raise the volume (left earbud) or skip backward a track (right earbud). A long press on either summons your device’s voice assistant. We’re used to models that split functions across the earbuds (for instance, so that increasing the volume or moving forward a track all happens on the right earbud), but the buttons are responsive and the control layout is easy enough to memorize.,An , means they can withstand splashes and low-pressure jets from any direction, but you can't submerge them or expose them to a faucet. The charging case isn't water-resistant at all, so make sure to fully dry the earpieces before you dock them. This rating is above average for the price, but if you need fully ,, consider the Tribit FlyBuds 3 (IPX7) instead.,The charging case's primary color matches that of the earphones, and the lid uses the same color as the stems' outer panel. Status LEDs sit on the front, while the back has a USB-C port for the included USB-C-to-USB-A charging cable. The case is a bit bulky, but it’s easy to handle and open because of a somewhat grip-friendly outer coating.,JVC estimates that the earbuds can last roughly seven-and-a-half hours on battery and that the case holds an additional 22.5 hours of charge. Of course, your results will vary based on your typical listening volume level.,As mentioned, there's no companion app for this model, which means you don't get access to an , and can't customize the controls. At this price, we can't expect too many extras, however.,On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” the earphones deliver impressive low-frequency thump. The lows don't distort at top listening levels, and the bass still has plenty of body at moderate volumes. The highs remain in balance with the lows.,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, better reveals their sound signature. The low-end drum thumps on this track sound almost thunderous, but they still pair nicely with the higher-register percussive hits and acoustic strums, which have a bright presence. Callahan’s baritone vocals exhibit both a low-mid richness and crisp treble edge. Although some users might want more of a high-mid presence, that's simply not an option here without an EQ.,On the hip-hop track “No Church in the Wild,” the kick-drum loop receives enough high-mid presence for its attack to retain its punch, but it’s the vinyl hiss and crackle in the background that take more of a step forward. Meanwhile, the sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat come across with impressive depth. It doesn't quite sound as if there's a subwoofer in each earpiece, but the low-end power is still intense. The best part is that these elements don't overpower the mix; the vocals sound clear, even though we would prefer a little more high-mid focus.,The lows in orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, get more attention than is ideal for purists, but the spotlight remains on the higher-register brass, strings, and vocals. Again, the high-mids would benefit from more emphasis, but these elements never sound muffled.,The mic array offers average intelligibility. We could understand every word from a test recording on an iPhone, but we did notice some Bluetooth audio artifacts in the signal. The signal is still strong enough that you shouldn't have any issues with calls over a reliable cell signal.,We like a lot about the JVC HA-A9T earphones despite their budget-friendly price. We can easily look past SBC-only audio, and the lack of a companion app to see the bigger picture: They offer stronger audio performance than we would have had any right to expect just a few years ago. Otherwise, the IPX5 water resistance rating makes them somewhat durable, and the battery life should be sufficient for most users.,You can’t do much better for under $50, though we are still partial to the aforementioned Tribit FlyBuds 3 because of their better waterproof rating and AAC support. If you have a more flexible budget, the , earbuds ($99.99) are our top under-$100 pick because of their excellent sound quality and strong active noise cancellation. And if you want to spend even less, the , earphones offer decent bass depth for $24.99.,Although they don't feel very premium, the water-resistant JVC HA-A9T earphones still impress with a punchy (but balanced) sound signature.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

JVC HA-A3T Review,"These inexpensive earphones aren't a very good value,I've been a contributing editor for PCMag since 2011. Before that, I was PCMag's lead audio analyst from 2006 to 2011. Even though I'm a freelancer now, PCMag has been my home for well over a decade, and audio gear reviews are still my primary focus. Prior to my career in reviewing tech, I worked as an audio engineer—my love of recording audio eventually led me to writing about audio gear.,JVC's HA-A3T true wireless earbuds cost just $25, but you don't have to spend much more to find alternatives that fit better and offer more consistent sound.,Although our expectations aren't exactly high for , under $30, at the very least we want decent, consistent sound quality. Unfortunately, we can't say this is true for JVC's $24.95 HA-A3T earphones due to an open design that makes it difficult to get consistent stereo imaging. Competing models under $50, including the exercise-friendly , ($35.99) and even JVC’s , ($49.95) are simply better choices for your money.,Available in black or white, the stem-style HA-A3T earpieces fit securely enough despite their open design. Sound performance is another issue entirely, though. Because they sit outside the ear canal, it's difficult to get a consistent ear-to-ear stereo image and a suitable amount of bass. This was true of open-style earbuds 15 years ago and it remains the case now.,Regardless, 11mm neodymium dynamic drivers deliver a frequency response of 20Hz to 20KHz, with an impedance of 16 ohms. The earphones are compatible with Bluetooth 5.1 and support just the SBC ,, not AAC or AptX.,A capacitive touch panel sits above the stem on each earpiece. A single tap on either earbud controls playback and calls. Double and triple taps on the left earpiece lower or raise the volume, while the same gestures on the right earbud move you back or forward one track. Long presses on either activate your phone's voice assistant. It’s a little more common for gestures (such as double taps) to control a specific aspect (such as the volume), but this control layout works well and the buttons are very responsive.,An , means the earpieces can withstand light splashes or mists from any direction, but you can't submerge them or rinse them off under a faucet. Yes, this rating is a bit modest, but we have little room for complaint at this price. That said, the aforementioned Tribit Flybuds 3 boast a far more impressive IPX7 rating.,The charging case's attractive semi-matte material makes it easy to grip (in contrast with the glossy earbuds) and sports an etched JVC logo. The front panel houses status LEDs, while the back has a USB-C port for the included USB-C-to-USB-A charging cable.,JVC estimates that the earphones can last roughly 7.5 hours on a charge and that the case can provide another 15 hours of battery life. Those are decent claims for the price, but your results will vary based on your typical listening volume levels.,We don't necessarily expect an app at this price, but the lack of means you won't be able to tweak the sound via an , or customize the control layout.,On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife’s “Silent Shout,” the drivers deliver impressive bass depth in light of their price, but nothing can save them from their basic design flaw. It's very difficult to position each earpiece so that it sits exactly the same way in each ear. It’s certainly possible for the earbuds to feel secure at varying angles, but that invariably leads to an unbalanced audio presentation. Furthermore, there’s no trick to getting it right—you have to start from square one each time you put them in—and the act of adjusting them is likely to trigger accidental control presses. All that aside, if you do manage to achieve a perfectly consistent ear-to-ear fit, the sound signature is a pleasant surprise. We noted robust bass and relatively defined highs in this listening test. ,Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the sound signature, but again, the inconsistent imaging makes it almost impossible to get a completely transparent picture. In ideal scenarios, the drums sound almost thunderous and the highs sound crisp, but other times we struggled to even get one earpiece to sound as loud as the other.,On the hip-hop track “No Church in the Wild,” the kick drum loop receives enough high-mid presence for its attack to retain its punch, while the sub-bass synth hits come across with some nice depth. Yet again, however, the uneven ear-to-ear imaging makes it difficult to fully enjoy the drivers' capabilities. ,Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams’ ,, have a bright presence if you can get an optimal fit. The higher-register brass, strings, and vocals remain in the spotlight here, while the lower-register instrumentation provides some appropriate anchoring.,The mic array sounds average at best. We could understand every word from a test recording on our iPhone, but the signal was a bit quiet and Bluetooth artifacts took over in spots. Calls shouldn't be an issue over a reliable signal, though the mics aren't likely to save you from a weak connection.,The ideal customer for the JVC HA-A3T earphones is someone with a lot of patience and who doesn’t mind a lopsided sound signature. The open-ear design is a shame because, at times, these earbuds produce surprisingly good audio. Ultimately, you don't have to look hard to find other low-cost true wireless earbuds that offer superior value, including the aforementioned JVC HA-A9T and Tribit FlyBuds 3. We also like the , ($29.99) and the , ($24.99), because they too seal off the ear canal and sound better as a result. The bottom line is that unless you expressly prefer an open design, you have superior options even in this budget segment.,JVC's HA-A3T true wireless earbuds cost just $25, but you don't have to spend much more to find alternatives that fit better and offer more consistent sound.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flip OLED (Q529ZA) Review,"A 2-in-1 laptop with a stellar panel...but where's the GPU?,A powerful processor without discrete graphics limits the appeal of the Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flip, a 15.6-inch, convertible 2-in-1 laptop with a fast and sharp OLED display.,Big screens always stand out in the convertible-laptop crowd, but this Asus machine has a different, less obvious distinction. A widescreen, 15.6-inch ,, the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip OLED (model Q529ZA; $1,199.99 as tested) comes in a snazzy deep-blue chassis but features an unusual component arrangement: a high-power 12th Gen Intel Core i7 H-series processor paired with...integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. (Most laptops we’ve seen with Core i7 H-series CPUs are gaming or content-creation models with dedicated GPU muscle.) The Zenbook Pro 15 Flip also features a rare , with a crisp 2.8K resolution along with a 120Hz refresh rate. With no discrete GPU, however, it’s a shame that gamers or even some content creators can’t fully leverage such a fast, sharp panel. This decision and a few other, minor shortcomings keep us from giving this flashy, attractively screened Zenbook a higher recommendation.,Asus' Zenbook Pro 15 Flip OLED is an all-aluminum vision in a hue the company calls ""Azurite Blue."" It’s gorgeous, allowing the laptop to stand out from the silver-and-black brushed-aluminum crowd. In certain light, the color looks black, but it flashes blue when the angle changes or the ambient light brightens. The touchpad is a slightly lighter (but still deep) shade of blue and presents a pleasing contrast to the rest of the keyboard deck.,The aluminum chassis is thinner and lighter than most 15.6- or 16-inch models, but it might be a case of being a little too thin and too light. The 0.74-by-14-by-9-inch (HWD) aluminum feels thin and a bit flimsy—it flexes in spots and doesn’t feel as rigid or rugged as other all-metal models. At 3.97 pounds, the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip is lighter than other 15- and 16-inch laptops. By comparison, the , weighs 4.19 pounds, and the , weighs 4.45 pounds.,The high-resolution (2,880-by-1,620-pixel) OLED display is the star of the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip's show. The panel produces an incredibly crisp and dynamic image with stellar contrast and vibrant colors. It's rated for a substantial 550 nits of brightness, and white levels are quite bright, while OLED’s ability to completely turn off individual pixels results in inky blacks. Colors generated by the screen are accurate and vivid.,Most OLED panels feature the standard 60Hz refresh rate or perhaps 90Hz, but the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip’s display runs at 120Hz and with a 0.2ms response time. Movement in videos—and what games it can handle—look smooth, but the system’s gaming ability is severely limited by its integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. Gamers and even animators looking to take advantage of the fast OLED panel will be disappointed by not only the system’s integrated graphics but also the inability to upgrade to a discrete GPU.,The speed of the OLED panel is new, but its shape and size are not. While many laptops at this size feature 16-inch displays with a 16:10 aspect ratio, the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip sticks with a conventional 15.6-inch, 16:9 widescreen panel. It’s a more natural fit for watching movies and shows, but the 16:9 ratio can feel a bit cramped when multitasking or just scrolling through a long web page or document, versus a taller 16:10 display. We prefer the extra room and added versatility of a 16:10 display for a general-use laptop and especially for a 2-in-1 convertible. In laptop mode, the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip’s widescreen display feels a bit awkward now—it’s too tall and narrow compared with a dedicated tablet.,Along with the old-school, 15.6-inch 16:9 panel comes a dated 720p webcam. Many laptops we’ve seen this year aside from budget models feature 1080p cameras that produce finer, better-balanced images. And sure enough, the picture from Zenbook Pro 15 Flip’s webcam is grainy and overexposed, with reddish skin tones and details lacking in bright areas. At the end of 2022, we expect better webcam performance from a laptop at this price.,Many models at this size find room for four speakers that produce fuller sound than a twin set, but the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip sticks with a basic pair of speakers that produce basic sound. Bass response is nowhere to be found, nor any separation between the highs and midtones. With the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip, you’ll want to keep your headphones handy.,The keyboard feels roomy despite the presence of a dedicated number pad, but the key response feels too soft and mushy. And while no keys were shortened to accommodate the numpad, the four arrow keys get the half-height treatment despite there being room for the left- and right-arrow keys to be full height. We do appreciate the keyboard’s three-level backlighting and the ability to dial in the brightness to the ambient light.,As if to mimic the widescreen display, the touchpad is wide, as well, and features a matte finish for smooth gliding. Moving the mouse pointer on the touchpad feels natural and is accurately recorded. The click response is snappy, too, with the perfect amount of travel.,Asus' Zenbook Pro 15 Flip port selection covers all the bases. On the right side, you get a pair of USB-C ports with , support, a combo audio port, and the power connector. (The laptop features a barrel charger instead of an increasingly common USB-C charger.),On the left, you’ll find a USB 3.2 Type-A port, an HDMI port, and a microSD card reader. The inclusion of a card reader is appreciated but makes us pine all the more for the option to upgrade the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip to a dedicated GPU since it’s a feature most used by media creators and editors. And as you’ll see in the next section, the system’s multimedia performance is pedestrian at best.,Our Zenbook Pro 15 Flip OLED (model Q529ZA) test system features the Intel Core i7-12700H processor, 16GB of RAM, integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics, and a 512GB SSD for $1,199.99 at Best Buy. The Core i7-12700H is a member of Intel’s 12th Generation ""Alder Lake-H"" series of 45-watt (W) mobile chips. The H series is the high-powered chip class in Intel’s lineup with the 28W P series in the middle and the efficient 15W U series at the other end. The Core i7-12700H features Intel’s new hybrid architecture with Performance and Efficient cores; it has six Performance cores, eight Efficient cores, and support for a total of 20 processing threads.,To put the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip’s performance in perspective, we compared it with other Core i7-based laptops. What’s notable here is that the , (starts at $929; $1,229 as tested) is the only other laptop we’ve tested with the same CPU/GPU pairing as the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip. The other two laptops you’ll see in the benchmark charts—the Dell G16 and the , (starts at $1,389; $1,809 as tested)—feature the more common configurations of the Core i7-12700H with Nvidia GeForce graphics (here, the RTX 3060). Rounding out the charts is the Lenovo Yoga 7i 16 ($1,399.99), which features the Core i7-1260P and Iris Xe graphics. The Core i7-1260P is from Intel’s middle-ground 28W P series, including the same eight Efficient cores as the Core i7-12700H but only two Performance cores and a total of 12 processing threads.,UL's PCMark 10 is our main benchmark, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheeting, web browsing, and videoconferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess the load time and throughput of a laptop's storage. (See more about ,.),Three further benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally, we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better). ,Our last productivity test is Puget Systems' ,, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.,The Zenbook Pro 15 Flip’s PCMark 10 score is outstanding but you can see what additional thermal space can do even for general application performance—the Dell G16 and HP Envy 16 are clearly superior on the test. That the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip manages to edge the HP Envy 16 on our HandBrake and Cinebench tests shows it has ,multimedia chops. Unfortunately, Asus' laptop is led by the RTX 3060-based pair by such a wide margin on our Photoshop benchmark that it makes the Zenbook hard to recommend to photographers or anyone engaged in image editing.,We test Windows PCs' graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite: Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics), and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs). Two more tests from GFXBench 5.0, run offscreen to allow for different display resolutions, wring out OpenGL operations. ,Naturally, the Dell G16 and HP Envy 16 dominate the 3DMark tests here, a hardly surprising result, thanks to the RTX 3060 GPUs. (The GFXBench test hiccuped on this laptop and would not run; more likely a fault of the test than the laptop.) It’s disappointing that the Zenbook Pro 15 Flip features a fast OLED panel and yet doesn’t include at least an option for a discrete GPU to let gamers or content creators take advantage of it. And, if such a feat isn't possible, then we'd rather see such a high-end screen deprioritized in future editions in lieu of a better webcam and a more hybrid-friendly aspect ratio. ,We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie ,) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.,Additionally, we use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its brightness in nits (candelas per square meter) at Windows' 50% and peak settings.,The Zenbook Pro 15 Flip lasted for roughly 8.5 hours on our battery-drain test, a slightly below-average result. With its more efficient CPU, the Yoga 7i 16 (Gen 7) ran for more than twice as long, while the HP Envy 16 nearly doubled its runtime despite the presence of high-powered dedicated graphics.,As for the display, the Asus panel hits 100% in the sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts, and 94% of the Adobe RGB spectrum, narrowly outclassed by the Acer Swift 3 and HP Envy 16. The display is also the third brightest of the bunch at 363 nits, which should be plenty for the work it's designed for, but this laptop has bigger bugbears.,This 15-inch laptop wows with its speedy, high-resolution OLED display, but then doesn’t offer the graphics needed by the type of users that would most benefit from it—namely, gamers and content creators. With the Intel Core i7-12700H, it’s halfway to being a suitable content creation convertible, but you are stuck with integrated Intel graphics, which puts a ceiling on its media-editing capabilities. ,Plus, despite the cool, deep blue aluminum chassis, we aren’t wild about the chassis or keyboard. Finally, the 720p webcam feels antiquated at this point. Better convertibles are readily available at this size and price, including the HP Spectre x360 16 and Lenovo Yoga 7i 16 Gen 7.,A powerful processor without discrete graphics limits the appeal of the Asus Zenbook Pro 15 Flip, a 15.6-inch, convertible 2-in-1 laptop with a fast and sharp OLED display.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Dell 14 Portable Monitor (C1422H) Review,"Dell leaps into the portable monitor market,Since 2004, I have worked on PCMag’s hardware team, covering at various times printers, scanners, projectors, storage, and monitors. I currently focus my testing efforts on 3D printers, pro and productivity displays, and drives and SSDs of all sorts. ,Dell's C1422H portable monitor offers a quality 14-inch screen with good brightness, contrast, and color coverage, as well as a sturdy, convenient stand. The USB-C display's controls are limited to a brightness slider and a low-blue-light mode.,The $359.99 Dell 14 Portable Monitor (C1422H) is a , with a basic feature set but a screen that's a cut above in quality, with ample brightness and contrast and superb sRGB color coverage. The monitor's frame has a sturdy feel, and its hinged stand provides great flexibility in the available angle of tilt. Two USB Type-C ports provide both data and power delivery. If you're okay with its minimal controls and lack of touch input, and don't need additional connectivity such as HDMI, the C1422H could prove a worthy investment. We'd just (ahem) monitor the varying discounts on Dell.com, which included $70 off at presstime. It's a better deal in the $200s than the $300s.,Dell's first true portable monitor, the C1422H has a matte-black front with narrow bezels on top and sides. A thicker bezel runs below the screen, decorated with a Dell logo in inlaid silver. The IPS panel's 14-inch (measured diagonally) anti-glare screen has full HD or 1080p resolution (1,920 by 1,080 pixels) with a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. The frame's bottom and back are silver-gray, making it a good match for a , laptop (or my ,, which I also used in testing along with a ,). ,The cabinet enclosing the screen is connected to the base with dual hinges similar to those of the ,-series portable monitors and Lenovo Yoga laptops. (In both design and features, the C1422H is very similar to the ThinkVision M14 and seems to be modeled on it.) This design makes for smooth movement and a range of tilt adjustment from 10 to 90 degrees away from the user. We prefer the hinged stand to the so-called origami (folding) stands found on many, especially lower-priced, portable monitors.,The C1422H comes with a soft gray cloth carrying sleeve, open on one long side. It provides basic protection when transporting the monitor within a backpack or bag.,The ports and controls are also on the base. On the right are the power button and a USB Type-C port. On the left you'll see a second USB-C port, plus a rocker switch to increase or decrease brightness and a button for enabling or disabling what Dell calls ComfortView (low-blue-light) mode. ,Notably absent is an onscreen display (OSD) menu for changing picture mode, contrast, and other settings. In the three years since we reviewed the Lenovo M14, most new portable monitors—including , and , and even some budget models like the Editors' Choice-award-winning ,—have come to include OSDs, some letting you control an extensive range of display options. ,Whether you actually need the extra functions that an OSD can offer is an open question. For workaday business or casual personal or travel use, you can probably do fine with just a brightness control. But if you often edit photos or are a film buff or gamer, being able to change color mode and other settings is essential.,Both USB-C ports support up to 65 watts of power delivery, enabling you to power or charge a laptop connected to the C1422H when the monitor is plugged into an AC outlet. The exact amount of power passed through to the laptop depends on the wattage of your adapter, as the monitor itself consumes about 15 to 20 watts.,I did our color and brightness testing using a , and , software. Dell rates the C1422H's luminance (brightness per unit area) at 300 nits (candelas per square meter), and it fell just short of that at 274 nits in my measurement. That's brighter than most portable monitors, which tend to cluster in the 180-to-200-nit range. Exceptions are the ThinkVision M14 (280 nits) and M14d (287 nits), the , (272 nits), and the , (245 nits) and , (219 nits).,I measured the Dell display's contrast ratio at 1,100:1, which is considerably better than its 700:1 rating. General-purpose portable monitors usually have contrast ratios of about 1,000:1. ,The C1422H's color gamut coverage is very good for a portable panel. In my testing, it covered 97.7% of the sRGB space (see the chromaticity chart below), matching the Asus XG16AHPE and close to the Lenovo M14 and M14t (97% and 97.9% respectively).,The Dell C1422H's design and build closely resembles that of Lenovo's ThinkVision M14. Each has a high-quality 14-inch screen, a sturdy hinged stand, and two USB-C ports that support both power delivery and DisplayPort over USB Alternate Mode. They also share a minimalist approach to controls, with a rocker switch to control brightness and a button to toggle between normal and reduced-blue-light levels. One small difference is that the M14 has a slot for a Kensington security lock that the Dell lacks. The two displays are also similarly priced, each available online for as low as $269 at presstime.,Although you can think of the C1422H as basic, it has some key selling points including a solid frame, one of the best stands we've seen in a portable monitor, and a panel that's bright with good contrast and nearly full coverage of the sRGB color space. Whether you use it in a coffee shop, a hotel room, or a conference room, or just on your patio, the Dell 14 Portable Monitor gives you extra screen area for multitasking or letting colleagues sitting around a table easily see what your laptop's showing.,Dell's C1422H portable monitor offers a quality 14-inch screen with good brightness, contrast, and color coverage, as well as a sturdy, convenient stand.

Yale Assure Lock 2 Review,"A versatile, aesthetically pleasing smart lock,I'm PCMag's expert on fitness and smart home technology, and I've written more than 6,000 articles and reviews in the 10-plus years I've been here. I unbox, set up, test, and review a wide range of consumer tech products from my home in Florida, often with the help of my pitbull Bradley. I'm also a yoga instructor, and have been actively teaching group and private classes for nearly a decade. ,The Yale Assure Lock 2 is a style-minded smart lock that makes it easy to go keyless and manage access to your front door while offering interoperability with many popular third-party smart home platforms.,Whether you're renting your home out to guests, want to monitor your dog walker's comings and goings, or you're just tired of fumbling around with keys, a , can add serious convenience to your life. The Assure Lock 2 from Yale is sleeker and smarter than the , and supports Apple HomeKit on all models. It starts at $159.99 for a Bluetooth-only version, while the top-of-the-line touch-screen model with Wi-Fi goes for $259.99. No matter which you choose, the Assure Lock 2 lets you lock and unlock the door in multiple ways, create and manage access codes for guests, and view a timeline of door and lock activity. The $249 , remains our Editors' Choice winner for its biometric fingerprint scanner, but the Assure Lock 2 is a strong competitor with a striking design. ,Ranging from $159.99 to $259.99, the Assure Lock 2 collection is made up of four models, which are up to 30% smaller than their predecessors.,The base models feature a keypad with physical buttons, though you can upgrade to a touch screen for $20 more. Each is available key-free or keyed, the latter of which features a mechanical key cylinder that works with a physical key. Key-free and keyed models cost the same. The Assure Lock 2 is available in three finishes: Black Suede, Oil-Rubbed Bronze, or Satin Nickel. ,All models work with the Yale Access app (available for Android, iOS, and watchOS) via Bluetooth and support Apple HomeKit. In the box with the Assure Lock 2 you also get Yale's DoorSense device, which uses a magnetic sensor to track when your door is open and closed. ,To control the lock beyond the limited Bluetooth range (about 30 feet), you need a Wi-Fi Smart Module, which inserts into the back of the lock and allows for remote management via the Yale Access app from wherever you are. For added convenience, the Wi-Fi Smart Module no longer requires a Wi-Fi Connect Bridge, so it's simpler to set up and doesn't occupy a wall outlet. Yale sells a version of the Assure Lock 2 with the Wi-Fi Smart Module preinstalled (starting at $239.99), or you can purchase it separately for $79.99 and add it to the lock yourself. ,For this review, Yale sent me the key-free, touch-screen Assure Lock 2 with Wi-Fi in Satin Nickel ($259.99). ,Yale also plans to launch Z-Wave and , Smart Modules (priced at $79.99 apiece), which should make it easier to integrate the Assure Lock 2 with your , ecosystem of choice. With a Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, or Matter Smart Module, the lock works with , and a wide variety of third-party security and automation systems, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Philips Hue, Ring, and Samsung SmartThings. ,The Assure Lock 2 collection fits on doors measuring 1-3/8 to 2-1/4 inches thick with a deadbolt bore hole of 2-1/8 inches (the standard size in the US) or 1-1/2 inches (commonly found in Canada), and a backset of 2-3/8 inches or 2-3/4 inches.,Regardless of which model you choose, the lock is powered by four AA batteries, which are included in the box. Bluetooth-only locks should last between six and nine months before you have to swap out the batteries. Adding the Wi-Fi module, however, shortens battery life to just three months, Yale says. Battery life varies depending on use and other factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and the internal friction of your deadbolt. I burned through the batteries in my Wi-Fi-enabled unit in just seven weeks, but I locked and unlocked it dozens of times each day while working on this review. ,Unfortunately, the app doesn't display the battery level at all until it drops below 20%. When the batteries do reach that critical level, the Assure Lock 2 warns you via a notification in the app, a red light on the device itself, and an audible sound. I wish it pushed these alerts much sooner. In testing, I got locked out—during a torrential downpour while wearing just socks on my feet—before I received one of the low-battery warnings in the app. ,If the batteries die and you get locked out, you can still open the door in one of two ways. With the keyed model, you can simply use the key. With the keyless model, you can use a standard 9V battery to power it from the outside. When I got locked out, I used the latter method (after my kind neighbor drove me to the store) and it worked. You simply place a 9V battery against the terminal on the bottom of the exterior keypad or touch screen, then the display should light up so you can type in your code to get in.  ,Changing out the batteries is simple: Just slide the battery cover off the interior lock, pull the ribbon to remove the old ones, insert the new ones, and reinstall the cover. ,A Yale spokesperson says the majority of buyers go with a keyed model because they want that physical backup for peace of mind. If the battery dies and you aren't carrying the key with you, you'll need to call a locksmith to get back in. The risk of getting locked out is actually lower with the keyless model because you can always grab a 9V battery at the store to power it back up. The choice is up to you, but I went with the key-free model for its more streamlined design and 9V battery backup option. ,Most people should be able to install the Assure Lock 2 on most doors themselves with just a standard Phillips-head screwdriver, provided it fits in the place of your previous lock. Adjusting an existing door or prepping a new door for the Assure Lock 2 complicates the process and requires some additional tools, including a drill, a utility knife, a wood mortise chisel, a tape measure, and a level. ,As mentioned, if you've changed out a deadbolt lock in the past, you shouldn't have any problems installing the Assure Lock 2. I'm not adept at such tasks, so I enlisted my handy neighbor Ali, who has installed several smart locks of different brands in the past. ,Yale includes a written and illustrated installation guide in the box, and the Yale Access app can also guide you through the process. From start to finish, Ali completed the installation of my review unit in about two hours, though he notes he was taking his time. ,Installing the optional DoorSense device, which may require drilling a hole with a 5/8-inch paddle bit, as my door did, was the trickiest part. The DoorSense can be installed on wood or metal door frames.,In testing, I had no trouble pairing the Assure Lock 2 with its companion Yale Access app. If you're new to the app, you'll need to create an account, then verify both your email and phone number using one-time codes. Next, press Set Up a New Device and then use your phone's camera to scan the QR code on the lock (inside the battery compartment or on the quick start guide). ,After the app locates your device, it asks whether you want to view the installation instructions or begin setup. The first step of the process is to name your house in the app and specify which door the lock is on. Next, the app instructs you to open and unlock the door so it can calibrate the device. The calibration only takes a minute or so. Once complete, you should be able to control the lock through the app via Bluetooth. If you opt to use the DoorSense device it will also need to be calibrated, but this step is equally quick and easy. ,If you have the Wi-Fi Smart Module, you need to enter your Wi-Fi password in the app to connect the lock to your home network. Note that the Wi-Fi Smart Module only supports the 2.4GHz frequency and doesn't work with 5GHz networks. ,During the setup process, the app prompts you to create the four- to eight-digit entry code you'll use to unlock the door. At this point, I created unique codes for myself, my neighbor, and my dog walker. When inviting others to use the lock, you can give them full app access or just a personal entry code. You can pick your own numbers to customize the codes so they're easy to remember. ,The Yale Access app is simple and well organized, making it easy to manage your lock. The app features tabs at the bottom that let you quickly check your lock and door's current status, lock and unlock the deadbolt with a tap, view a timeline of lock and door activity, and create and manage access codes. ,In the app's Lock Settings menu, you can set up automations like Auto Unlock and Auto Lock, and enable Apple HomeKit so you can control the lock with Siri voice commands and Apple's Home app. Here, you can also enable Smart Alerts to be notified about certain events, like when the door is locked/unlocked manually, locked/unlocked by a specific user, left ajar, auto locked, or keypad locked. ,When not in use, the exterior touch screen turns off, so all you see is the Yale logo at the top. To unlock it with the touch screen, you simply tap the Yale logo, enter your code using the numbered buttons on the display, then tap the checkmark button. Neither I nor any of my guests with an access code had any trouble unlocking the door this way. The lock came in handy when I traveled to Berlin to cover the ,, allowing my dog walker to easily come and go twice a day to take care of my dog Bradley.,The Auto Unlock feature, which uses Bluetooth to detect when you are near to automatically unlock the door, is particularly useful—usually I'm still collecting things from my car when I hear it automatically unlocking. With notifications from the Yale Access app enabled, it sends an alert when it's automatically unlocking the door. That said, when used with the Wi-Fi module, the lock sometimes failed to automatically unlock in testing, in which case I had to type in the code to open the door. ,As mentioned, you can lock and unlock the Assure Lock 2 with one tap via the Yale Access app on your smartphone or Apple Watch, and this feature worked reliably in testing, but I almost never used it because the other methods are easier. ,The Wi-Fi Smart Module is a nice addition, but I wouldn't call it a must-have feature since I spend most of my time at home. For me, the main benefit of the Wi-Fi connection is being able to check the door and lock status wherever I am. With a Wi-Fi connection, you can also remotely lock and unlock the door, monitor the activity feed, and continue to receive notifications when you're out and about. Without a Wi-Fi connection, these features will only work within Bluetooth range. And, as noted above, the Wi-Fi module sometimes interfered with the Bluetooth Auto Unlock feature.,In testing, I had no trouble connecting the Assure Lock 2 with several third-party smart home platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Assistant, via their respective mobile apps. I could then control and monitor the lock with voice commands such as ""Siri, lock my front door"" via a ,, ""Hey Google, what is the status of my front door"" via a ,, and ""Alexa, lock my front door"" via an ,. ,The Yale Assure Lock 2 can elevate the look of your door while adding convenience to your life. Ranging from $159.99 to $259.99, it offers a good variety to meet your needs, preferences, and budget, including keyless and keyed models with physical buttons or a touch screen. All models feature Bluetooth and work with the Yale Assure app and Apple HomeKit, and you have the option to add Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and control. Battery life for the Wi-Fi version could be better, but we otherwise have few complaints. The competing Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro Wi-Fi ($249) has the edge thanks to its fingerprint scanner, but the Assure Lock 2 is an excellent alternative, especially if minimal aesthetics strike your fancy. ,The Yale Assure Lock 2 is a style-minded smart lock that makes it easy to go keyless and manage access to your front door while offering interoperability with many popular third-party smart home platforms.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Lenovo ThinkVision M14d Review,"A super mobile monitor for laptops with squarer screens,Since 2004, I have worked on PCMag’s hardware team, covering at various times printers, scanners, projectors, storage, and monitors. I currently focus my testing efforts on 3D printers, pro and productivity displays, and drives and SSDs of all sorts. ,Lenovo's ThinkVision M14d portable monitor pairs well with laptops that match its 16:10 aspect ratio. A sturdy, tiltable stand and a quality IPS panel distinguish this winning mobile display.,The Lenovo ThinkVision M14d , ($499) has much in common with its 14-inch predecessors—the ,and touch-enabled ,—but fills a niche all its own. It skips the 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio format of most notebooks and mobile displays in favor of a slightly taller 16:10 ratio that's become increasingly popular among laptops of late. It has a higher native resolution than most portable panels, a sturdy hinged stand, and dual USB-C ports that support both data and power delivery. It's not cheap, but the M14d earns our latest Editors' Choice award among portable monitors.,The ThinkVision M14d is nearly identical in appearance and features to the M14 and M14t; the most obvious difference is the housing that accommodates its extra vertical screen space. Although we've seen several monitors with 16:10 aspect ratios—including the , and ,—recently, the M14d is the first 16:10 portable monitor we've reviewed.,Actually, 16:10 panels were common in the early years of the century, but by 2010 most monitors had followed laptops' migration to the widescreen 16:9 format used for digital television. That aspect ratio gives notebooks a small advantage in compactness and portability, and 16:9 is ideal for movie and video viewing and editing. But 16:10 monitors are a better fit for photo editing because they're closer to the 3:2 aspect ratio of full-frame and APS-C digital SLRs and the 4:3 aspect ratio of Micro Four Thirds and many point-and-shoot digital cameras. The taller layout is also good for office productivity, as a 16:10 monitor lets you see more rows of a spreadsheet or more lines of a Word document or webpage without scrolling.,Among 16:10 monitors, while the Acer CM2241W packs 1,920-by-1,200-pixel (WUXGA) resolution and the Dell U3023 has 2,560 by 1,600 (WQXGA), the Lenovo M14d has an IPS panel with 2,240-by-1,400-pixel resolution (and no alphabet-soup acronym to go with it). The only other device I've encountered with this resolution is the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro laptop.,The ThinkVision M14d is a good match in color (raven black) and design for Lenovo laptops, especially in the ,. Counting its stand, it measures 8.5 by 12.4 by 4.2 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.3 pounds. The frame holding the panel attaches to a flat base, which extends behind the screen and supports it via two hinges. This gives the stand a sturdy feel and a full range of tilt adjustment; the top of the screen can be moved anywhere from 5 to 90 degrees away from the user. This is preferable to many portable monitors' ""origami"" folding stands that support only two or three specific tilt angles.,As for the monitor's ports and controls, on the left side of the base are the power button and a USB Type-C port, along with a notch for a Kensington cable lock. On the right are a second USB-C port, a button that launches the onscreen display (OSD) menu, and a rocker switch that helps navigate it. From the OSD, you can control settings such as brightness, contrast, display mode (sRGB, Neutral, Warm, or Cool), language, and aspect ratio. In testing with a 16:9 aspect ratio laptop, with the M14d set to Original AR (aspect ratio), the mirrored image of the computer screen fills the display's width with black bars above and below; the Full Screen setting vertically stretches the image to fill the panel's height. I preferred using the Original AR setting to avoid the minor distortion inherent in stretching the image.,The Lenovo's range of OSD settings are about average among recent portable monitors. The , and the ,, both rival touch-enabled portable monitors, feature mini joystick controllers for navigating their OSDs. The gaming-centric , has a robust OSD that includes gaming-related settings. The ThinkVision M14t's menu is largely centered on its touch features. The ThinkVision M14's controls are limited to a rocker switch to increase or decrease brightness and a button to toggle low-blue-light mode, as with the ,.,You can connect the M14d to a laptop using either the right- or left-side USB-C port, depending on which side of the laptop you want to put the display. You can even connect to an Android smartphone if it has a USB-C port. The ports support both DisplayPort over USB Alternate Mode and USB power delivery, letting you power or charge a laptop connected to the monitor with the latter plugged into a wall outlet.,The M14d comes with a soft, charcoal-gray carrying sleeve that provides a measure of protection when the display is being transported in a bag or backpack.,As usual, I did our color and brightness testing using a , and , software. Lenovo rates the ThinkVision M14d's , at 300 nits (candelas per square meter); it came up just short of that at 287 nits in my testing. This is in the upper tier of brightness for portable monitors; the Asus Strix comes close at 272 nits, while the ThinkVision M14 delivers 280.,The monitor's advertised contrast ratio is 1,500:1; I measured it at 1,231:1, which is obviously less but still among the best we've seen from a mobile display. Most competitors have contrast ratios somewhere between 700:1 and 1,000:1.,The M14d has good color gamut coverage for a portable monitor, covering 96.3% of the sRGB space in my testing (see the chromaticity chart above). That's slightly lower than the Asus Strix's 97.7% or the 97% and 97.9% of the Lenovo M14 and M14t respectively, but considerably better than the ViewSonic TD1655's measly 61.1% sRGB coverage.,In addition to our formal testing, I viewed a selection of film clips and photos using both a 16:9-aspect-ratio , (using the monitor's Original AR setting) and a 16:10 ,. In both cases, videos were bright, with well-saturated colors, and showing very good contrast in both light and dark areas. Photos also looked bright, with natural-looking colors and excellent contrast.,If you own one of the many laptops now on the market with a 16:10 aspect ratio, and you want to pair it with a portable monitor, you can't do better than the Lenovo ThinkVision M14d. It will match your notebook's screen, letting you take full advantage of the extra vertical space that the taller ratio brings. Of course, you can use the display with a 16:9 laptop as well, though you'll either get a little blank space above and below the image or a slightly mismatched (or possibly stretched) view.,The display includes the features we've applauded in other ThinkVision M14 models—a sturdy stand with a wide tilt range, dual USB-C ports that let you position the monitor on either side of the laptop, and support for USB power delivery as well as DisplayPort over USB. Its screen is bright, with good contrast and color coverage, and it has the handy onscreen display the original M14 lacks.,The M14d's only real sticking point may be its price, which puts it alongside the ThinkVision M14t, the Asus XG16AHPE, and the 15-inch , in the realm of premium portable monitors. Still, it's money well spent, especially if you have a 16:10 laptop. The ThinkVision M14d is our latest Editors' Choice winner.,Lenovo's ThinkVision M14d portable monitor pairs well with laptops that match its 16:10 aspect ratio.

AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT Review,"Radeon screamer should be a bit cheaper,For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming. I began working on computers owned by immediate family members and relatives when I was around 10 years old. I've always sought to learn as much as possible about anything PC, leading to a well-rounded grasp on all things tech today. In my role at PCMag, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to share what I know.,The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT delivers fierce performance for 1440p and 4K play, though its faster RX 7900 XTX sibling, at only $100 more, makes it a harder sell.,Launching at $899, AMD's new RDNA 3-based Radeon RX 7900 XT is ,like a budget ,. PC gamers will likely have to wait well into 2023 for anything built on AMD's new architecture that we'd consider truly ""budget-friendly,"" but this is now the most affordable ultra-high-end GPU of AMD's and Nvidia's new generations. It's also your only option, so far, between AMD's Radeon RX 7900 line and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 series, that's under $1,000—the alternative is buying a last-generation card. It's a corker, but the performance drop that comes with this price cut makes it a notably less attractive option than AMD's Editors' Choice award-winning , that debuted alongside it. However, the smaller RX 7900 XT still may well be worth picking up if you catch it on sale...or if you simply can't lay your hands on an RX 7900 XTX, which sold out within minutes of launch earlier this week.,AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XT doesn’t fall far from the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX in any significant way. Put another way, they are about 10% off each other in price, with the Radeon RX 7900 XT costing $899 and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX coming in at $999. We see a similar trend in terms of hardware resources, as the Radeon RX 7900 XT utilizes the same graphics processor as the 7900 XTX—just with a few pieces missing.,A few hardware components have been disabled on the RX 7900 XT, likely due to chips with slight flaws binned to be 7900 XT GPUs, but this only creates a relatively small difference between AMD’s two new graphics cards. In ,, we covered AMD’s new RDNA 3 microarchitecture and its chip, so we won’t go over those details in depth here. Instead, we will focus on the basics of what’s inside of the Radeon RX 7900 XT.,A cornerstone of AMD’s new RDNA 3 GPUs is that they are built using chiplets instead of large monolithic chips. This includes a single large chip called a Graphics Compute Die (or GCD) and several smaller chips that are called Memory Cache Dies (MCDs). The GCD holds most of the core function units, like shaders, TMUs, and ROPs. The MCDs hold memory controllers, and the GPUs have Infinity Cache.,On the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the GCD contains 6,144 streaming processors, 384 TMUs, 192 ROPs, and 96 Ray Tracing cores, and the shaders are clocked at 2,300MHz with a boost clock of 2,500MHz. The Radeon RX 7900 XT contains the same GCD, but with some shaders disabled, leaving 5,376 streaming processors, 336 TMUs, 168 ROPs, and 84 Ray Tracing cores active. The clock speed was also reduced slightly, to 2,000MHz with a boost clock of 2,400MHz.,The Radeon RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT both have six MCDs, but one of these units is disabled on the Radeon 7900 XT. The Radeon 7900 XTX, with 96MB of Infinity Cache and a 384-bit memory interface, has 20GB of GDDR6X RAM that enables 960GBps of bandwidth for that card; the Radeon RX 7900 XT loses about a sixth of this across the board, giving it 80MB of Infinity Cache, a 320-bit memory interface, and 800GBps of bandwidth while also using 20Gbps GDDR6X vRAM.,AMD reworked various aspects of the Radeon RX 7900 XT to fit these reductions. In addition to having fewer cores and less bandwidth, the Radeon RX 7900 XT has a lower 315-watt TDP and a smaller overall physical size, as it measures 4.4 by 10.9 by 2.1 inches (HWD). Three fans are fit over the card to provide cooling in this AMD reference design.,The ports on the card are identical to the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, with both cards featuring two eight-pin PCI Express power connectors, two DisplayPort outputs, one HDMI port, and a USB Type-C port.,We tested the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT on our 2022 GPU test bed, which consists of an , processor running at stock clocks on an , motherboard. The processor has access to 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM running at 5,600MHz, and the processor is kept cool by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler.,The system also contains a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD as its primary storage device with Windows 11 Pro installed. Power is supplied via a Corsair HX1500i 1,500W 80 Plus Platinum power supply.,With both AMD and Nvidia only having two graphics cards each in their new product generations, competition at the moment is a bit scarce. Both of Nvidia’s new RTX 40-series graphics cards are significantly more expensive, with the , and the , costing $1,199 and $1,599, respectively.,Due to the large price difference, the main competitor of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is currently AMD's own Radeon RX 7900 XTX. With just a $100 difference between them, if you are considering either, it’s well worth thinking of both. There are also last-gen cards, but as you’ll see in a moment, even the best of those don’t offer much competition against the Radeon RX 7900 XT, especially when the price is taken into consideration. We may not recommend upgrading if you already have one of the high-end, last-gen cards in the chart, but we’d also hesitate before buying one of those at this point.,Synthetic test results show the Radeon RX 7900 XT and the Radeon RX 7900 XTX relatively close together with between an 18% and 26% difference in the worst and best cases, respectively. ,These tests don’t mean much, as they are more of an indication of the best-case scenario for each card under narrow usage cases, and aren’t really indicative of real-world performance. Real test results are a bit less consistent, but in this case, they match up with the synthetic results more often than not.,With or without FSR on, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX manages to hold between an 11% and 17% performance gap over the Radeon RX 7900 XT in F1 22 and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.,Nvidia’s RTX 40-series notably have superior performance in games that implement Ray-Tracing, their performance when FSR and DLSS—AMD and Nvidia's upscaling technologies, respectively—are used seems to favor AMD's FSR, at least in F1 22. The GeForce RTX 4080 still beats the Radeon RX 7900 XT in this test without a doubt, but the 5% lead at 2K and the 6% lead at 4K are especially small when you consider the $300 price difference between these two cards.,Here is where things get a little more negative for the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT. The performance results from these tests heavily favor the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, with a 10% to 24% performance advantage. A performance gap of around 10% isn’t so bad, as that matches the relative drop in price between these two cards. However, a whopping 24% advantage indicates that you would get far better value from a Radeon RX 7900 XTX for just $100 more.,There are a few tests that show the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and the RX 7900 XTX close together, but we have reason to believe that the CPU is creating a bottleneck in these tests. The best we can say for the Radeon RX 7900 XT here is that its performance, once again, draws surprisingly close to the GeForce RTX 4080 in a few select tests. The difference in Far Cry 5 at 4K is only 5% in the RTX 4080’s favor, and it is just 14% behind in Red Dead Redemption 2.,Performance in legacy games is frequently all over the place, with the best we can say is that all of these tests succeeded in running. This is something we aren’t always able to say.,The legacy games we test do use generally run better on Nvidia’s RTX 40-series cards, but that win is undercut by these games running even better on the older RTX 30-series cards than the RTX 40-series. Overall, the games run well enough on most cards, including the Radeon RX 7900 XT. If you plan to play older games, however, we suggest picking up an older graphics card or PC for that purpose.,We test the power draw of the entire system using a Kill-A-Watt monitor to gauge power consumption between cards. Power consumption on the Radeon RX 7900 XT comes in about on par with many of the card’s other test scores—which is to say roughly 10% lower than the 7900 XTX.,The temps we measured during testing are slightly higher, but still quite low compared to many last-gen cards. We also noticed during testing that the 7900 XT doesn't get as loud as the 7900 XTX, and it was typically significantly quieter. This points to the GPU’s fans not running quite as hard, and the slightly higher temps and quieter operation are likely due to a difference in cooling settings right out of the box.,It’s hard to deny that the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT performs well in the games that we tested. This card runs everything smoothly, cleanly outperforming the last-gen AMD cards, and occasionally pressuring the much pricier Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080. At the same time, however, it falls a bit further behind the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX than we would like to see for the slim $100 difference in price.,If you’re ready and willing to pay $899 for a high-end graphics card, are you really going to stop there and not pay the extra $100 for a card that performs anywhere from 10% to 24% better in games, and more often than not landing closer to being 20% faster?,Not everyone is willing or able to pay this much for a graphics card to begin with, but we have trouble believing that those who can and will won’t just get the better card...especially when you get overall better value and performance for a relatively small price increase. In short, we recommend the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, if both cards are available at their suggested prices.,Given the test data, $849 (or even $799) feels like a more reasonable price for the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, as the difference in savings would more accurately match the difference in performance. If and when the card goes on sale, consider buying it then...or if the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX is simply unavailable and you don’t want to wait any longer.,The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT delivers fierce performance for 1440p and 4K play, though its faster RX 7900 XTX sibling, at only $100 more, makes it a harder sell.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Brother ADS-3100 High-Speed Desktop Scanner Review,"Straight-up document scanning, basic connectivity,I focus on printer and scanner technology and reviews. I have been writing about computer technology since well before the advent of the internet. I have authored or co-authored 20 books—including titles in the popular ,and, series—on digital design and desktop publishing software applications. My published expertise in those areas includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, and QuarkXPress, as well as prepress imaging technology. (Over my long career, though, I have covered many aspects of IT.),Brother's entry-level ADS-3100 is a capable sheetfed document scanner that's a good value for home, hybrid, or small offices and workgroups.,At the bottom of the pecking order in Brother's recent release of a wave of sheetfed desktop ,, its ADS-3100 High-Speed Desktop Scanner ($329.99) is relatively fast and reliably accurate. It lists for about $40 less than the next model up, the ,, but you give up quite a lot for the savings: network connectivity, a touch-screen control panel, and support for smartphones and other handheld devices, to name a few convenience and productivity features. That's not to say, however, that small or home offices that plug the ADS-3100 into a solitary computer's USB port (or scan directly to a USB flash, solid-state, or hard drive) won't get good value from this scanner. Competition among entry-level and mid-volume document scanners is formidable, but if your business doesn't demand networkability or wireless scanning, this Brother model should serve you well.,The ADS-3100 is the last of five new sheetfed document scanners from Brother to reach our test bench. The , is the high-volume flagship (and an Editors' Choice award winner), and the midrange ,, ,, and ADS-3300W are excellent as well. They are all the same size. The five Brothers measure 7.5 by 11.7 by 8.5 inches (HWD) with their paper trays closed—like most scanners in this category, they double or triple their desktop footprint with trays extended for use—and weigh 6.2 to 6.5 pounds each.,This scanner has too many direct competitors to list here, so we'll name just four key ones: the ,, the ,, the ,, and the ,. The ADS-3100 falls short of some rivals by lacking a color touch screen. Its control panel holds only four buttons (Power, Stop/Cancel, Scan to USB, Scan to PC) and a few LED status indicators. This and the ADS-4300N are the only members of the new Brother quintet to lack touch screens.,You can scan to a variety of PDF types (high-compression, image, searchable, secure, or signed), as well as PDF/A, single-page and multipage TIFF, BMP, plain text, and Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint formats. The scanner's maximum resolution is 600 dots per inch (1,200dpi interpolated), and it supports document sizes ranging from 2 inches square to 8.5 inches wide by 16.4 feet long, with 24-bit color depth. ,Online scanning destinations include cloud and social media sites and FTP sites, as well as local drives and email. It's easy to access most social media and cloud sites, though the ADS-3100 is preconfigured to support Google Drive, OneDrive, Evernote, Box, Dropbox, OneNote, SharePoint Online, and Expensify.,The ADS-3100 features a 60-sheet automatic document feeder (ADF) for sending single- and double-sided multipage documents to the scanner. Brother rates its daily duty cycle at 6,000 scans. These specs match the ADS-4300N's; the ADS-4700W has a larger 80-page ADF, while the more robust ADS-4900W combines a 100-sheet feeder and 9,000-scan daily duty cycle.,These specs are more or less average among low-end document scanners. The Raven Select, Epson ES-400 II, and ScanSnap iX1400 all have 50-sheet ADFs, while the Canon R50's holds 60 sheets. The Fujitsu has the same 6,000-scan duty rating as the Brother; the Epson and Canon are rated for 4,000 and the Raven for only 2,000 daily scans.,Of the five new Brother document scanners, the ADS-3100 is the only one without a wired or wireless network interface—its sole connectivity option, apart from the USB Type-A port around back for scanning directly to storage devices, is a USB 3.0 (or 2.0) cable. That leaves out smartphones and tablets.,The software bundle doesn't reflect this printer's lower-end status, though. It includes Brother iPrint&Scan (desktop) for Windows and Mac, Brother ScanEssentials Lite for Windows, Kofax Power PDF for Windows, Presto! BizCard for Windows and Mac, Image Folio Processing Software for Windows, and Kofax PaperPort SE with OCR for Windows.,iPrint&Scan is an all-in-one printer interface that's also compatible with Brother's single-function scanners and printers. It lets you create and manage workflow profiles that you can choose with the front-panel buttons.,ScanEssentials Lite, meanwhile, is a trimmed-down version of another Brother scanner interface that's also a document-management and financial-data archiving application. Kofax PaperPort also combines a scanner interface with document-management features, among them its own optical character recognition (OCR), workflow profiles, and automated naming conventions.,Presto! BizCard is what it sounds like, a business-card-scanning and contact-archiving program, and Image Folio is an image-capturing program designed to help you scan, edit, enhance, and print photos. You also get four third-party drivers—TWAIN, WIA, ISIS, and Sane—for scanning directly into many compatible applications, such as Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop and the Microsoft 365 suite.,Like its siblings (barring the flagship ADS-4900W), the ADS-3100 is rated at 40 one-sided (simplex) pages per minute (ppm) and 80 two-sided (duplex) images per minute (ipm, where each page side is counted as an image). I put those speed figures to the test using iPrint&Scan over a USB connection to our Intel Core i5 testbed running Windows 10 Pro. (I also ran a few tests with some of the other apps and got similar results, though scanning to USB flash drives is notably faster; see more about ,.),First, I clocked the ADS-3100 as it scanned our standard one-sided 25-page and two-sided 25-page (50 sides) documents and then converted and saved them as image PDF files. The scanner managed 41.6ppm and 81.3ipm, barely beating its ratings. The competitors mentioned here did similarly, with the ADS-4900W being faster (68.7ppm and 125.4ipm) and the Epson ES-400 II being slower (37.7ppm and 66.7ipm).,Next, I timed the Brother as it scanned our two-sided, 25-page hard-copy document and saved it to the more versatile searchable PDF format. The ADS-3100 finished the job in 38 seconds, on the high side of average. The ADS-4900W and the , took 34 seconds and 24 seconds respectively, while the Canon R50 took 37 seconds. The Fujitsu made it in 40 seconds, versus 41 for the Raven Select and 44 for the Epson. Frankly, unless you spend most of your day scanning stacks of lengthy documents, these scores should be fast enough for most offices.,Besides, how well a scanner reads text is more important than how quickly it does so. Most document scanners today can convert printed text to searchable PDF format with no errors down to 5 or 6 points. The Brother ADS-3100 was perfectly average, managing scans down to 6-point type problem-free in both our Arial and Times New Roman font tests. Of the other machines discussed here, only the Canon R50 yielded a different result: down to 5 points for Arial, and 6 points for Times New Roman. You're not likely to encounter text smaller than 10 points in most real-world business documents.,I also scanned a few stacks of business cards into Presto! BizCard, with predictable results: The software does a fine job of digitizing text and figures and putting them into the proper fields in a contacts database (or exporting them to Outlook, Gmail, and other contact management or personal information manager apps). Finally, to see how well the Brother handled images, I scanned several photos to Image Folio. Most were well-detailed, with bright and accurate colors, showing the ADS-3100 can serve as a decent sheetfed photo scanner or alternative to the , and ,. If you have a shoebox of photos stashed under the bed or on a closet shelf, the Image Folio software should deliver additional value.,If you can live without networked or mobile scanning, the Brother ADS-3100 may be right for you, especially if you also have a bunch of photos to archive (though it's more of a document than a photo scanner). Without wireless or Ethernet connectivity, however, it's really more of a personal machine for relatively low scanning volumes, around a few hundred per day. (You'd have to fill its 60-sheet ADF 100 times per day, or 14 times per hour, to reach its 6,000-scan limit.) Under the right conditions, though, the ADS-3100 is without question a fine entry-level-to-midrange document scanner.,Brother's entry-level ADS-3100 is a capable sheetfed document scanner that's a good value for home, hybrid, or small offices and workgroups.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Hasselblad X2D 100C Review,"A luxury camera that looks as good as its 100MP photos,Images, and the devices that capture them, are my focus. I've covered cameras at PCMag for the past 10 years, which has given me a front row seat for the DSLR to mirrorless transition, the smartphone camera revolution, and the mainstream adoption of drones for aerial imaging. You can find me on Instagram ,.,The Hasselblad X2D 100C wraps a powerful 100MP medium format sensor in a gorgeously designed exterior, while speed and battery life upgrades make the X2D a high-end camera that photogs will love to use.,It took a couple of tries, but with the X2D 100C ($8,199, body only), Hasselblad finally gets the luxury medium format mirrorless camera mostly right. The X2D addresses many of the shortcomings of its predecessor and it's notably more responsive than either X1D model. The X2D is also a stunning camera to look at, is as speedy as it looks, and its picture quality is simply sublime. Photographers in search of a tool that's as beautiful as the pictures it can produce are sure to love it, though the , ($5,999) is a more practical pick, and our Editors' Choice winner for medium format cameras.,Hasselblad knows how to make a good-looking camera. While we had our share of complaints about the X2D's predecessor, the ,, its looks were not among them. The X2D hits the same marks, though there are a few refinements, including a darker metallic finish and a tilting rear display.,It's a pretty camera outside, with the influence of European design firms showing through. The X2D is a digital camera that could have come out of the Bauhaus; its form follows its function, without crossing the line over to the side of brutalism. Function is at the forefront, but there's plenty of attention paid to aesthetics.,The X2D 100C is also a little taller and thicker than the X1D, a change made to accommodate the X2D's sensor-shift stabilization system. Even so, at 4.2 by 5.8 by 2.9 inches (HWD) and around 2 pounds, it's quite small for medium format, especially one with IBIS. The stabilization system is an important feature for getting the clearest results from the 100MP image sensor.,Inside, the new camera enjoys a significant boost in speed, which addresses one of the biggest shortfalls of the X1D platform. Quicker start-up and processing times, along with faster autofocus, make for a more pleasing photographic experience. The X2D responds as a high-end camera should.,Hasselblad doesn't advertise the X2D as being weather protected, however. It's certainly well made, and we can see some visible gaskets in the battery compartment and around the lens mount, but I'm not nearly as confident recommending the camera to serious landscape photogs when the Fujifilm GFX100S is available. Fuji puts robust dust and splash protection in its GFX cameras and lenses, so they're better picks for outdoor photographers. I wouldn't fret about being caught under a rain cloud with the X2D, it's not going to melt away like the Wicked Witch of the West, but I also wouldn't plan to take it outdoors for shots if a downpour or blizzard is in the forecast.,While older medium format digital systems absolutely begged to be mounted on a heavy, sturdy tripod, the X2D is versatile enough to be used handheld. Its handgrip is cleverly molded and conforms to my medium-sized-glove-wearing hands. The rear thumb rest is also a treat; it's oversized, to the point that it's essentially a second rear grip, and goes a long way to make the X2D comfortable to handhold for longer photo sessions.,Hasselblad keeps controls to a minimum. Front and rear control wheels adjust exposure, and there are a handful of buttons on the rear to drive focus, lock exposure, toggle on-screen overlays, and navigate menus. Mode and an ISO/White Balance button are on top, along with an OLED information display. Buttons are supplemented by a touch interface; the X2D's menus use big icons and easy-to-tap toggles to change settings.,The rear display looks great. The oversized 3.6-inch LCD is packed with 2.4 million dots, offering up a sharp, bright view of your frame. The X2D adds a hinge with up to 70 degrees of tilt. I definitely appreciated the tilting display when snapping photos with the camera low to the ground; it meant I didn't have to get real low to get a handle on the frame. But because the X2D's viewfinder juts out from the rear, the top of the display is obstructed when viewing from above.,We've nothing bad to say about the viewfinder, it's one of the largest and sharpest you'll find in any mirrorless camera. The viewfinder sports a half-inch display for life-size 1.0x magnification, so you can get a clearer idea of the details the 100MP sensor is capturing. The finder is also pleasing to look through; its 5.8-million-dot resolution and 60fps refresh rate match up for a clear, steady view through the lens.,The camera matches up well with purpose-built XCD lenses I paired it with during our review period. I tried two primes, the XCD 38mm F2.5 V and XCD 55mm F2.5 V ($3,699 each), but there are a dozen more available, with focal lengths as wide as 21mm and as tight as 135mm. Most lenses for the system are fixed focal length primes, but Hasselblad does offer one zoom, the XCD 35-75mm F3.5-4.5 ($5,175), and also has an exotic bright f-stop lens for shallow depth of field work, the , ($4,845).,XCD lenses are priced higher than full-frame glass, generally speaking. The , is the only budget-minded option, and at $1,100 that's relative. There's a big gap between it and the second-lowest-priced lens in the lineup: The XCD 45mm F3.5 is priced at $2,695.,All XCD lenses include an in-lens shutter, called a leaf shutter. These shutters introduce much less vibration than a big in-camera focal plane shutter, and also support flash sync at quick speeds—most do 1/2,000-second. With the Fuji GFX system, you're limited to sync at 1/125-second, though the Fuji does support high-speed sync (HSS) to make up for the drawback. HSS puts more stress on your lights, though, requiring them to fire a few times in quick succession for an exposure, so it's better for occasional use.,You can get away with a smaller strobe with a leaf shutter lens. I used a , off-camera with a Nikon-compatible TTL remote to add some illumination to outdoor shots, and was able to use the small strobe to add some fill on a bright day. Compatibility with Nikon's TTL system is a good thing—there are plenty of good lights and remote systems to use. I tested it with Godox gear, but Hasselblad tells us the X2D will also work with Profoto and Nikon TTL remotes.,The X2D can use manual focus lenses for other systems with an appropriate ,. It relies on an electronic shutter for adapted lenses, though, which is limiting. You can't use a flash along with the e-shutter, for one, and if there's quick subject motion (or if you're panning to follow a moving subject), expect ugly skewed distortion. The sensor reads out pixel-by-pixel, and it just can't get through all 100MP quickly enough to freeze motion. I did find the e-shutter to be useable for handheld shots of static subjects, though. That's an upgrade from the X1D II 50C's e-shutter; the older Hasselblad required a very steady hand when using its e-shutter.,The X2D improves upon one of the X1D's major shortcomings: battery life. The X1D struggled to reach 200 shots on a full battery, which really hampered its usefulness for travel. Hasselblad rates the X2D for more photos, up to 420 per charge, though that may be an ambitious estimate. I wasn't able to use the camera over an extended enough time period to get a real handle on battery life, but based on a couple of photo walks starting out with a full charge, I'd expect real-world results closer to 350 exposures before exhausting the battery.,The improvement in endurance is a difference-maker. It means the X2D is a camera you can take out for a day about town without constant worry about running out of juice. I'd recommend budgeting for a spare battery ($99) to get the most out of the camera, especially if you tend to snap a lot of photos during the course of the day. With two batteries, the X2D is an all-day camera, but it doesn't quite get there with just one.,Batteries charge in-camera via USB-C, and you can run the X2D from AC power if you're using it in a studio. A dual-battery charger is an optional accessory, though it's pricey; at $155, it costs more than a spare battery. You may find the convenience of charging two batteries simultaneously, out-of-camera, to be worth it, however.,Many photographers won't have to worry about getting a memory card for the X2D. The camera includes an ample 1TB SSD inside, that's enough for more than 3,500 Raw+JPG snaps. If you need more or prefer to use a removable card, there is a single slot with support for speedy CFexpress (Type B) media. There's no support for SD, but you'll want to use high-speed cards to handle 100MP Raw images anyway.,Studio photographers can connect the camera to a Mac (10.15 or later) or 64-bit Windows (version 7 or later) system running Phocus software, the Gen2 3.1 USB-C connector offers an easy connection for remote control. The experience is a little underwhelming, however. Phocus is limited to triggering the camera, and can be set for sequenced exposure bracketing, but doesn't show a live view from the camera, nor does it allow you to change the f-stop, shutter speed, or ISO. You'll need to set exposure from the camera body, making for a less-than-full-featured tethering experience. There's room for Hasselblad to update the software to improve the interface, of course.,The X2D also includes Wi-Fi to connect to iPhones and iPads, but the required Phocus Mobile 2 app hasn't yet been updated to support the camera. Hasselblad had previously promised to update the app for the X2D in 2022, but as I sit here in mid-December it's nowhere to be seen. We're told it's on the way, though, and Hasselblad encourages its X2D owners to check the iOS App Store for updates.,Hasselblad cameras are known for a lot of things, but speedy operation isn't one of them. The X2D won't do anything to change that perception, but at least it's not a slog to use like the sluggish X1D cams that came before it. A quicker start-up time is a highlight; the X2D powers on, locks focus, and snaps a photo in about 3 seconds flat, versus about 8 seconds for the X1D II 50C. More importantly, the X2D supports a sleep mode; it wakes, focuses, and snaps a photo in about 1.2 seconds, which is reasonable for medium format.,Autofocus is also sped up. The focus system is still rudimentary—the X2D supports two sizes of focus box, and that's it. You can move them around with the control wheels or by tapping the screen. Focus isn't quite instant, it takes about 0.3 seconds to confirm a focus lock and take a picture with the XCD 55mm F2.5 V lens, but it's not nearly as slow as the X1D II's 0.7-second lag.,I'll admit, though, that Hasselblad could do a bit more to make using its basic focus system a pleasing experience. A dedicated focus joystick control is at the top of my wishlist for the inevitable X2D II. The rear LCD works as a touchpad control for focus in its stead, however, and proves to be both smoothly responsive and intuitive.,If you're averse to touch (or wearing winter gloves), you can also use the control wheels to move the focus box around; the rear wheel supports a push-in action to swap both wheels to focus control. You'll use the rear wheel to move the focus point up and down the y-axis, and the front to set the x-axis. I could never get my brain to remember which was which and spent a lot of time fumbling around with this interface, but I only had a couple of weeks to use the camera for review. I hope I'd be able to keep things straight if the X2D was my full-time camera.,The X2D keeps its autofocus system simple, and while certain photographers may find the bare-bones approach appealing, we're a little disappointed that the company didn't do a little bit more to boost autofocus. Face and eye detection for people is a basic, expected feature in swappable lens cameras, and is supported by the Fuji GFX100S.,We're not asking for features that don't make sense for Hasselblad—bird and train detection are much more sensible for full-framers with telephoto lenses in the library, like the , and ,, but we would like to see the X2D's focus better match up against Fuji.,The heart of the X2D 100C is its image sensor, a 44-by-33mm BSI CMOS chip with a staggering 100MP of resolution. It's no secret that the sensor is Sony-made, just like the one inside Fuji's GFX100 series, but the two brands take different approaches to image processing. Hasselblad applies its Natural Color Solution to its Raw and JPG output, while Fuji offers up a bevy of analog-look , for the GFX. Yes, light hits the same silicon, but what the cameras do with it differs.,Hasselblad expects most X2D customers will work to adjust color and tone to taste, and its 16-bit Raw format hammers that home. Yes, the camera can save 8-bit JPGs too, but few shopping for a high-end camera are interested in the format.,And the Raw files are quite editable. You can use the Phocus tethering software to process them (or Phocus Mobile, once it's updated), and there's some support for the X2D's Raw format in other software. You can process X2D images in the latest edition of ,, and while , hasn't gotten support yet, but it supports older Hasselblad digitals, so we suspect support is coming. We do not expect any compatibility with ,, however. Despite its popularity as a Raw processor, its maker Phase One is a direct competitor to Hasselblad and has never included support for Hasselblad cameras in its toolkit.,I processed images using Lightroom; it's our standard Raw processor here at PCMag, and I'm much more comfortable using it than Phocus. The X2D's Raw photos show clear detail without too much grain through ISO 6400 when using Lightroom's standard noise reduction settings. Grain is more visible at ISO 12800, but picture quality is still excellent. There's a step back at the top ISO 25600 setting, though, as the grain is a little rougher and larger, enough to detract from clarity. For JPGs, there's a bit less noise, but also less contrast and fine detail, at high ISOs. The real limitation is the 8-bit format, which leaves little room to adjust color without significant loss of picture quality.,Raw files on the other hand are extremely malleable. With 16-bit color, the transitions between tones are sublime, with a bit more nuance than full-frame and APS-C chipped cameras, not to mention that you can edit color and exposure to your heart's content. There is a drop to 14-bit color if you use the 3.3fps continuous drive mode, which puts the X2D's color on the same footing as full-frame cameras.,As for video, it's easy to address: the X2D doesn't support movie recording. If you want video from medium format, the Fuji GFX100S is the way to go. However, generally speaking, smaller sensor cameras do better for video; cinema users on a budget are better off with a full-frame (35mm), APS-C (Super 35), or Micro Four Thirds mirrorless.,Hasselblad beat Fujifilm to market with the original X1D by a matter of days, cementing its position as the first to deliver a medium format mirrorless camera to customers. Unfortunately, the X1D had more than its share of quirks, enough for this reviewer to caution photogs against jumping into the system, especially considering how much better Fuji's initial GFX models were.,A few years and a couple of iterations later, the X2D 100C enters the scene and has righted many of its predecessors' wrongs. It's generally faster to respond and operate, so you're not waiting around for the camera to turn on or find focus, and you don't have to stress out (as much) about running out of battery power, even though you should still budget for a spare battery along with an X2D. Picture quality is also improved. A 100MP sensor offers twice the pixels, a more useable electronic shutter, and in-body image stabilization. Autofocus isn't as advanced as it is with other system cameras, but it's quick enough and accurate.,I'll also say, from a personal perspective, the X2D is a treat to use. I only had a couple of weeks to test drive the camera, but I looked forward to slinging it over my shoulder for my daily walk about town and for a trip to my local hiking trail. While I generally enjoy using cameras during a review, it's rare that I , , to using one. For a camera that falls into the luxury category for many of us, the enjoyment factor is an important consideration.,Overall, the X2D is a big step forward for Hasselblad. No, it's not the most practical high-pixel camera to buy; instead, it earns points for its standout design and the , that goes with using it to make images. Pragmatists can look to our Editors' Choice Fuji GFX100S as a more sensible tool, one that costs less and does more, with picture quality that's just as good. But artists and passionate photographers will find good reason to go Hasselblad instead.,The Hasselblad X2D 100C wraps a powerful 100MP medium format sensor in a gorgeously designed exterior, while speed and battery life upgrades make the X2D a high-end camera that photogs will love to use.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Adobe Acrobat Pro Review,"The best PDF app, but it'll cost you,Adobe Acrobat Pro is the powerhouse of PDF editing and management apps from the company that created the format. A subscription isn’t cheap, but the app’s capability and flexibility are worth the price.,When it comes to digital files, PDF is the one format to rule them all. It’s the one format that lets you exchange formatted documents with anyone, anywhere, using any operating system. Adobe invented the portable document format in 1993, and in its many versions, Adobe Acrobat is the one app that towers over all others that view and manage PDFs, even if other apps are better in some aspects. This review focuses on Acrobat Pro, the highest-end of Acrobat’s many versions, but even the minimalist free version, Adobe Acrobat Reader, is worth having if you don’t want or need the full versions.,Acrobat isn’t cheap. Acrobat Pro costs $19.99 per month with a one-year commitment, or a much less costly $239.88 per year if paid for the year upfront. If you pay month to month with no commitment, it's $29.99 per month. Pro runs on Windows and macOS. ,A lower-featured Acrobat Standard, for Windows only, costs $12.99 per month with a one-year commitment, or $155.88 if you pay for the full year upfront. It's $22.99 per month if you pay monthly with no commitment. If you choose Standard, you don’t get document comparison, redaction, or built-in OCR that converts scanned PDFs to editable documents. ,As a software reviewer, I get a lot of free review copies of many apps, but Acrobat Pro is one of the few apps I happily pay for every year. If you don’t like subscriptions, older, lower-featured permanent-license (one-time payment) versions are available: Acrobat Pro 2020 costs $538.80, and Acrobat Standard 2020 costs $358.80. ,The free Adobe Acrobat Reader version is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. It lets you add comments to PDFs as the full-priced versions do. You can use two desktop or laptop copies of Acrobat with your account; it doesn’t matter if the two copies are on the same OS platform or different ones. If you start up Acrobat on a third machine, you’ll be prompted to log out of one of two machines you already use, and you can always go back to the logged-out machine and log in again.,Why should you pay for a PDF app? After all, modern operating systems have built-in PDF viewing and markup software that let you draw arrows and circles or add text-only notes to existing PDFs. Microsoft Edge does this under Windows, and Preview does the job on a Mac. ,A commercial app like Acrobat Pro adds optical character recognition (OCR) to convert scanned documents into searchable PDFs. It also adds redaction features, editing features that let you correct typos and replace images, file-comparison features for finding differences between versions, and PDF-signing features that let you create and process documents for others to sign. Adobe stands out among the competition for its secure Document Cloud service that makes it easy to exchange PDFs via the cloud and lets you perform advanced signing and editing functions on Adobe’s mobile PDF apps.,A subscription-based copy of Acrobat updates itself every two or three months, and the latest release changes the app's name from Acrobat Pro DC to Acrobat Pro. If you’re a longtime user who never figured out that DC stood for Document Cloud, you’re a member of a popular club. ,Other recent enhancements include onboarding tutorials that appear when you first run the app or any of its tools that you haven’t used before. And, in the unlikely event that you own a , or , virtual-reality headset and want to manage PDFs in the metaverse instead of on your desktop or laptop, you can now—as of October 2022—install a Meta version of Acrobat to your headset and activate it with an existing Acrobat account or create a new account. I don’t see this as part of my future, but maybe it’s something you’ll want to try. Anything’s possible.,Acrobat takes some getting used to because its interface isn’t like anything else. Other PDF apps tend to have a ribbon-style interface, more or less like ,. Acrobat goes its own way with an interface that uses a standard top-line menu for opening and managing files and one or more toolbars for manipulating the content of a PDF document. ,When you’re merely viewing a PDF, Acrobat shows a standard toolbar with icons for viewing and sharing or selecting content. You can extend this toolbar with a customizable set of quick tools that you can choose from any of the app’s many features. A right-hand pane in the main window, which you can open or hide, displays a customizable list of other sets of tools for adding comments, editing, redacting text or images, scanning or OCR features, form creation and form filling, and much more. When you select one of these tool sets, a second toolbar appears below the standard one. The commenting toolbar, for example, lets you add text boxes, lines, arrows, circles and ellipses, and much more.,When you view a PDF, Acrobat lets you split the window horizontally so that one part of the file appears in the top pane and another part appears in the bottom pane. Unlike other PDF apps I’ve seen, Adobe also has a Spreadsheet Split feature that works like the freeze feature in spreadsheet apps that keeps the top row and left column visible while you scroll through the rest. This feature is useful mostly in viewing PDFs made from spreadsheets, but it could also be useful for keeping a map legend visible while you explore the rest of a map. ,Acrobat also offers a Reading view that hides most of the interface, but it doesn’t offer a view that displays only the unformatted text of a PDF, a feature I’ve found only in Foxit PDF Editor Pro. As in other PDF apps, you can drag and drop pages to reorder them and insert pages from other files and formats. For example, you can drag a Word document into the thumbnail images of an existing PDF, and Acrobat will convert the Word document into PDF format and insert it into the existing PDF pages.,Go deep into Acrobat’s interface, and you’ll find an astonishing wealth of features. The Comments toolset lets you write or draw almost anything on a file, and you can omit the comments when you export the file. From the Forms tools, you can create a fillable PDF form either by modifying an existing Word document or a PDF or by creating a form from scratch and adding text and fill-in fields from a toolbar. Advanced users and IT departments can apply JavaScript actions to form fields. The Forms tool set also lets you mail out the form and collect responses via email or set up a tracking system that sends out multiple PDF copies and gathers comments and markup into your original copy. ,Its interface has some inconsistencies because Acrobat has grown enormously over the years. For example, when you start with the Forms tool set, you can create a form from scratch, but when you access the same feature from the topline menu, the option to create a form from scratch is grayed out. No one seems to know why. ,Acrobat also allows you to create a web-based form on Adobe’s server, with a link that lets you add the form as a live page on your own website. You launch the form-creating process in Acrobat, but you create the form in a web browser using an Acrobat-like interface to upload an existing PDF or Microsoft 365 file. Then you add form fields and set up methods of sharing or tracking the form. Like all other advanced PDF apps, Acrobat offers full management features for creating and using digital signatures. ,Graphic designers seem to prefer Acrobat to all other PDF software for its uniquely powerful Preflight features that prepare files for professional printing and online display. Acrobat offers a long list of prebuilt operations for converting fonts and colors for specific print jobs, plus a troubleshooter that analyzes a PDF and suggests changes. I’m not a graphics professional, but I’ve used Acrobat’s Preflight features to fine-tune scanned PDFs to reduce file size without losing visual detail.,One major feature in commercial PDF apps is their ability to use OCR to convert a scanned PDF into a searchable PDF and export it to a standard, like Microsoft Word or Excel. If you need this feature, you should experiment with the free trials of all major PDF apps because there’s no way to predict which one will work best with the kinds of documents that you use. Over the years, I consistently get the best results from Editors' Choice winner , with its brilliantly powerful and efficient OCR editor that lets you correct OCR errors at top speed. ,Acrobat’s OCR software is very effective but doesn’t match FineReader’s in accuracy or efficiency, and its proofreading menu requires too many clicks for anyone to use it with a long document. Foxit PDF Editor Pro uses a licensed version of the technology in an older version of FineReader with a more awkward interface than the one in the current FineReader version. ,Another high-end PDF app, Kofax Power PDF Advanced, uses a licensed version of OmniPage’s OCR technology, less accurate than Acrobat’s or FineReader’s, and with a clumsy interface. And another PDF app, Nitro Pro, integrates technology from I.R.I.S., which, in my testing, ranks below FineReader, Acrobat, and OmniPage in power and convenience.,If you want to export a scanned PDF to a standard editable format, FineReader is by far the best choice because of its many options to export with different levels of formatting so that you’re more likely to get a document that isn’t cluttered with random marks from a scanned image. If you have a PDF that wasn’t scanned but was created directly from a word processor or spreadsheet, then any PDF app will do a serviceable job of exporting back to an Office format. But again, you should experiment with the documents that you normally use. One feature to keep in mind: Kofax Power PDF 5 Advanced and FineReader Pro both have a Watched Folder feature that automatically converts documents placed in that folder to PDFs.,For all its wealth of features, Acrobat sometimes surprises me by lacking a feature that one or more other apps include. For example, Acrobat has no whiteout tool for removing text or stray marks. Foxit PDF Editor Pro and Nitro PDF Pro both have one. In Acrobat and any other advanced PDF app, you can use the powerful redaction tool to remove text or graphics, but it requires more steps than seems necessary to simply remove some text. When you scan a book, your scanned images might contain two facing pages. ABBYY FineReader automatically splits those images in two, one for each page. Annoyingly, Acrobat doesn’t, although some users report success with a , that I haven’t tried.,Acrobat isn’t cheap, and you should consider alternatives before committing yourself to it. ,The most impressive alternative I’ve found is,, priced at $149 per year for a license that works on either Windows or macOS. A Foxit license is good for only one computer, however, not two as in Acrobat. The Foxit app integrates with Microsoft’s Azure Information Protection system and the iManage and eDocs digital management systems. It also has a text-only view option that I haven’t seen elsewhere. For me, the worst feature of Foxit’s app is its fuchsia-purple interface which can’t be changed to a less annoying color. , is priced attractively at $179 for a permanent license, no subscription needed. It includes a Watched Folder feature, and the many law offices that still use WordPerfect will value its option to export to WordPerfect. Like Acrobat, it lets you apply page numbering to thumbnail images so that the thumbnail numbering matches the numbers on the actual pages. Kofax’s advanced version is Windows-only, but you can choose a reduced Mac version called Power PDF 4.2 Standard for Mac ($129)., is also a one-time purchase, $179.99 for Windows or Mac, which you have to buy separately. It's slightly less feature-packed than other apps, with less effective OCR, but with an Office-like interface that’s easy to navigate. Because PDF is an open format, you can find many other apps at various price ranges that may be worth trying.,I said at the start that it’s hard to find an app that can create a PDF from a web page without inserting page breaks. In fact, I’ve only found one, and it exists only on the Mac. It’s called , (with the exclamation mark), and it’s freeware, with donations accepted. If you know of a Windows equivalent, please let me know.,What about free online PDF editing? Dozens of free cloud-based PDF services are out there, but I’m reluctant to trust them with my data. I use Adobe’s online services because Adobe is well-established and has enough high-powered clients to let me trust its security. But I really don’t want to start sending my files to an online site named something like FlyByNightPDF when I don’t know whether it’s based in a dictatorship where the government makes a copy of every file I send and I have no trust that the PDF I upload won't come back to me with hidden malware or spyware. When a site offers free PDF processing, it’s worth asking what the site might be getting in return.,Adobe Acrobat Pro is our Editors' Choice winner for PDF software thanks to its enormous power and deep feature set, despite the absence of a few convenience features like page-splitting and whiteout. If you already own our Editors' Choice winner in the OCR app category, ABBYY FineReader Pro, then it can double as a PDF app, though without the full feature set in Acrobat. Otherwise, you can’t go wrong with Adobe Acrobat Pro.,Adobe Acrobat Pro is the powerhouse of PDF editing and management apps from the company that created the format.

Opera VPN Pro Review,"This VPN is limited by its simplicity,Since my start in 2008, I've covered a wide variety of topics from space missions to fax service reviews. At PCMag, much of my work has been focused on security and privacy services, as well as a video game or two. I also write the occasional security columns, focused on making information security practical for normal people. I helped organize the Ziff Davis Creators Guild union and currently serve as its Unit Chair.,Opera VPN Pro is among the most affordable VPNs available, and tight integration with the Opera browser makes it easy for existing users to improve their privacy. For everyone else, it's a different story.,Opera has held its own for years as an offbeat browser and has recently expanded its growing list of capabilities with an affordable VPN option. Unlike Opera's free VPN, Opera VPN Pro can secure all the web traffic on your machine. It's also one of the most affordable VPN options. However, it requires you to install and use the Opera browser just to control the VPN, and it lacks features we've come to expect from the best VPNs. It also does not support iOS, which is a major drawback. For existing Opera users, it's a decent—if limited—choice. But if you're just looking for an , and not a browser, you'll be better served with ,, our overall Editors' Choice for VPNs and free VPNs.,Opera VPN Pro's most attractive aspect is its price. At $5.99 per month, it's one of the most affordable VPNs you can buy. That's significantly less than the $9.78 monthly average we've seen across the VPNs we've reviewed. It depends on the exchange rate, but the exchange rate sometimes makes the 5-euro-per-month Editors' Choice winner , more affordable ($5.27 at time of writing).,As with most VPNs, Opera VPN Pro is available at a reduced rate with a long-term subscription. An annual subscription with Opera costs just $23.88, making it the most affordable annual plan we've seen, beating out Kaspersky and , by $6. That's well below the $66.57 average for all the VPNs we've reviewed. Opera also offers a six-month VPN Pro subscription for $17.49.,While long-term subscriptions save you money, we caution against starting with one. Instead, we recommend choosing the shortest possible subscription so you can test the VPN in your own home. If everything goes smoothly, you can upgrade your subscription.,Opera VPN Pro is one of the , we've reviewed, but you can also use it for free. Opera's free VPN will limit your choice of servers, however, and will only route your Opera browser traffic through the VPN connection—nothing else is protected. Free users can also only select servers in broad areas—Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Upgrading to VPN Pro lets you secure all your device's web traffic, not just your browser's web traffic.,It's a simple and convenient free option, but there are other , worth consideration. TunnelBear VPN lets you connect an unlimited number of devices and use any of its worldwide server networks for free, but will limit you to 500MB of data per month (which can be raised to 1.5GB by participating in promotions). Proton VPN is our top pick for free VPNs, because this service places no limit on the amount of data free subscribers can consume. Opera's free VPN also allows unlimited data, making it more alluring.,Although its price is attractive, we found it difficult to purchase Opera VPN Pro. To buy a subscription you either need to download the Opera browser or visit a special site with the Android browser. This focus on the browser is a running theme for Opera VPN Pro, and not always a good one. ,You can purchase Opera VPN Pro with any major credit card. Other VPN services provide more privacy-respecting purchase options. Editors' Choice winners , and Mullvad VPN both let you purchase their products by sending cash to their respective HQs, for example.,When you switch on a VPN, all your web traffic is encrypted and routed to a server operated by the VPN company. This means that your ISP (and anyone else snooping on your connection) can't see anything you do online. It also hides your true IP address, which makes it harder to track your online movements and can stymie attempts to divine your physical location as well. All VPNs do this, so we examine what else each VPN provides.,The best VPNs we've reviewed provide multi-hop connections, which route VPN traffic through a second VPN server for additional security. A very few VPNs also offer direct access to the free Tor anonymization network. Opera VPN Pro has none of these features, but it's clear that—for better or worse—Opera VPN Pro is built around convenience rather than feature parity with the competition. Editors' Choice winners , and , are two of the small group of VPN services that offer all these features.,Nearly every VPN we've reviewed includes a Kill Switch. This blocks any web traffic into or out of your computer in the event the VPN is disconnected. That way, you can be assured none of your data snuck out unencrypted. Opera VPN Pro is notable in that it does , have this feature, which is curious. It does, however, include a setting to automatically reconnect if the VPN disconnects, but we'd like to see a true Kill Switch included.,Confusingly, while the free version of Opera VPN does provide split tunneling, which lets you send traffic to and from apps or domains outside the VPN connection, Opera VPN Pro does not. The free Opera VPN lets you set bypass rules so specific domains will not use the VPN connection. The company explained that because Opera VPN Pro encrypts all device traffic, while the free VPN only encrypts Opera browser traffic, the feature isn't applicable. We disagree, and we'd like to see Opera VPN Pro add split tunneling.,With an Opera VPN Pro subscription, you can connect up to six devices simultaneously. That's a bit higher than the average of five simultaneous connections we've seen across the industry. However, some VPNs have abandoned this limitation entirely. ,,,, as well as Editors' Choice winners , and TunnelBear VPN place no limit on how many devices you connect at a time.,Many VPN apps are now part of larger collections of privacy and security tools, whether it's established antivirus companies adding VPNs to their suites or VPN companies expanding into new territory. Surfshark VPN and NordVPN both offer their own antivirus tools, and Proton VPN gives customers access to secure email and file storage. Opera VPN Pro is tightly integrated to its browser, which includes built-in ad and tracker blocking, in addition to a number of ,.,One thing you won't get with Opera VPN Pro is iOS support. That's a major drawback, as nearly every other VPN we've reviewed offers support on all platforms.,VPNs are useful tools for improving your privacy, but they won't protect against every threat. We strongly recommend readers enable , wherever it is available, use a , to create unique and complex passwords for all accounts, and use , software on their machines.,Opera VPN Pro creates VPN connections on Windows and macOS using the IPSec protocol. On Android, Opera uses either IPSec or OpenVPN. As noted above, Opera VPN is not supported on iOS.,OpenVPN has long been our preferred choice among VPN protocols, as it is open-source and can be examined for any vulnerabilities. WireGuard is the open-source heir apparent to OpenVPN, and has seen wide adoption across VPN services. We'd like to see Opera add support for OpenVPN and , across its platforms.,Opera VPN Pro provides servers in 33 countries around the world, which is quite a bit below the 51-country average we've seen across the VPNs we’ve tested. Note, however, that if you are using the free desktop browser VPN, you only have access to three locations. The choice of countries, however, is not very geographically diverse. There are no servers in South America or Africa, two entire continents often ignored by VPN services. Opera VPN Pro does provide servers in , and some regions with repressive internet policies such as Turkey. It does not provide servers in , or ,.,Because of its slate of server locations, it's probably not well suited for world travelers or anyone who needs to appear as if they are in a very specific location. ,, notably, offers servers in 190 countries, but it relies heavily on virtual locations to accomplish that feat.,Speaking of virtual locations: Some VPN services use virtual servers, where a single hardware server hosts multiple virtual ones, or virtual locations, where a server is configured to appear someplace other than its physical location. Neither is inherently problematic, but we like to see transparency about how companies use each of them. A representative from Opera told us that all of Opera VPN's servers, both free and Pro, are physically located where they claim to be. We were also told that Opera VPN only uses physical servers, not virtual ones.,Like many companies adding a VPN to an existing product, Opera has help with their VPN infrastructure. Free members use servers owned and operated by Opera itself, while VPN Pro subscribers use NordVPN's servers. We've reviewed NordVPN many times over the years and have been satisfied with the efforts the company has taken to secure its infrastructure and protect its customers' privacy. ,Some companies, including , and NordVPN, use diskless or RAM-only servers. These are servers configured to save nothing to disk, and all the data they do hold is lost should someone attempt to physically remove the machine. A company representative told us that Opera VPN only processes user traffic in RAM, does not write any of this information to disk, and uses ""strong encryption standards"" to secure its infrastructure.,Opera VPN Pro’s privacy situation is a little more complicated than with other VPN services. To use the Opera VPN, you must install the Opera browser, create an account, and make your purchase. Next, you have to continue using the Opera browser to control the VPN. The trick is that the Opera browser has numerous services attached to it, all of which can affect your privacy in different ways.,First, let's look at what we know about the company's privacy policy as it relates to the VPN alone. In this policy, Opera says it does not log the sites you visit or any of your online traffic or activities, nor does it log your originating IP address. This is true for both free and VPN Pro customers. An Opera representative confirmed this to us as well, and said that the company does not monetize its VPN traffic. That's as it should be.,The policy goes on to acknowledge that the infrastructure for VPN Pro is operated by a third party, which we were told is NordVPN. The company explains that NordVPN only receives a random identifier in order for customers to access its infrastructure, but does not have access to any other user information.,Opera is owned by the company Opera Norway AS, and is headquartered in Norway. It operates under Norwegian law. NordVPN, for its part, operates under Panamanian law. Opera does not issue a transparency report to disclose its interactions with law enforcement nor what, if any, information the company has been compelled to provide. Nor does the company maintain a ,. It should consider doing both. We asked how the company would respond to legal requests for information. A company representative told us that Opera would inform law enforcement that it had no browsing information to share.,Many VPN services release third-party audits of their applications and policies, to give customers confidence that the companies are good stewards of their data. Editors' Choice winner ,, for example, is committed to annual audits and has released them for years. Opera's free VPN application and infrastructure were , in 2022. That's excellent. However, we'd like Opera to consider additional auditing that verifies the company is upholding its privacy policy. Opera notes that NordVPN, which operates Opera's Pro VPN infrastructure, has also passed several third-party audits. You can read about them in our review of NordVPN.,Using the Opera browser or other services beyond the VPN might expose more of your personal information, however. The browser stores user interactions with services like the built-in newsfeed or Shopping Corner in order to customize the content you see. This can include articles you've read and your approximate location. The company notes in its privacy policy that this information is associated with a random ID, not directly with your profile, and that using these services is optional.,On Android, the privacy situation is even more confusing. Opera's privacy policy says that the company uses several different IDs along with other information—such as categories of sites you visit, but not the sites themselves—to serve targeted ads to the users of some of its free services, such as in-app news. While the company works with ""advertising partners"" to serve these ads, Opera says your personal information is not transmitted to them and will be deleted after one year. That's a long time to retain such information, but having a date for deletion is a better privacy practice than many companies offer.,To its credit, Opera spells all this out in its privacy policy and provides some information about how to opt out of this data collection. It's also not alone in this practice. Hotspot Shield VPN monetizes its free service by serving ads through its Android app. It's important to note that these caveats to Opera's privacy policy do not relate to the VPN, free or otherwise. ,This would be less of a problem if Opera had modeled its VPN after ,. That service requires the use of a Firefox ,, but it provides a standalone application and does not require you to use the Firefox ,—or any other Mozilla application. This greatly simplifies the privacy situation for that product. Mullvad VPN goes much further, doing away with automatic payments and user accounts in order to avoid storing any customer information.,We tested Opera VPN pro on an Intel , desktop running the latest version of Windows 11. Unlike virtually every other VPN we've reviewed, Opera VPN Pro does , have a standalone application for Windows. Instead, you'll have to download and install the Opera browser. We found we weren't able to even buy a subscription without first installing the Opera browser (although the company's documentation notes there's an alternative method, for Android devices only). For existing Opera users, this is handy since you won't have to install yet another app. For everyone who doesn't use the Opera browser, you'll either have to start using Opera or put up with an unused browser gathering dust on your hard drive.,Although you must use the company's browser to use Opera VPN Pro, the VPN will encrypt the traffic for your entire machine. In our testing, we checked IP addresses in Google Chrome and Opera, and they were the same each time. The VPN connection also persists even when the Opera browser is closed.,You access the VPN controls from the pinky-purple VPN box in the URL bar of the Opera browser. Although installing VPN Pro adds a taskbar icon, this just toggles the VPN. Changing locations has to be done from the Opera browser. The VPN controls are straightforward, with a large button to connect the VPN occupying the majority of the window. We appreciate how easy it is to get Opera VPN running. ,The currently selected server appears just below the Connect button. Click this to select a VPN server location from a list. Unfortunately, Opera VPN Pro does not let you select specific servers or cities, only countries; nor does it provide any information on load or latency for servers.,Below the current server, Opera VPN Pro shows an IP address, but it was not clear to us what IP address was displayed. It was not our true IP, and was not the IP we were assigned when the VPN was switched on. A company representative explained that this was because IP addresses are assigned by NordVPN, which runs Opera VPN Pro's infrastructure. It might be better to not display these IP addresses since they apparently don't mean much.,It's just as well that Opera VPN Pro doesn't have its own application, because it doesn't have much in the way of features. Opening the Settings reveals just a few options, the only significant one being a toggle to automatically reconnect if the VPN becomes disconnected. Although this was toggled off in our testing, the VPN appeared to automatically reconnect anyway, which is a bit odd. Notably missing is a Kill Switch—a feature that prevents your computer from sending data over the internet if your VPN becomes disconnected. Opera must look at adding this basic function.,We don't test for the reliability of each VPN because, in general, most VPNs do a great job of providing a stable and secure connection. During our speed testing, we noticed that Opera VPN Pro disconnected several times, as mentioned above. While it's entirely anecdotal, this is unusual behavior for a VPN.,Many of our readers are keen to use VPNs to access online streaming content. In our testing, we found that while connected to a US-based Opera VPN server, we were only able to ,. What was available played just fine.,All of our VPN testing concludes with the DNS leak test, which verifies your DNS requests are also being secured by your VPN and not being sent to your ISP. When we first tested Opera VPN Pro, we were startled to see it repeatedly fail this test, which we carried out with the ,. Opera was extremely responsive to our concerns and could not replicate the problem, and we could not replicate the issue when using a different network. We were satisfied that the problem we experienced was likely an issue with our setup, rather than a problem with the VPN. That said, we have never encountered this problem with another VPN.,When using a VPN, you should expect increased latency, as well as slower uploads and downloads. To compare the impact of different VPNs, we find the percent change between Ookla Speedtest results taken with and without the VPN. You can read more about your testing, and its limitations, in our piece on ,.,We found that Opera VPN increased latency by 41.9%, which is just below—that is, better—than the median across all VPNs we've tested. Unfortunately, that's the one place where Opera VPN Pro did well. Our results show that it reduced download Speedtest results by 60.7% and upload results by 55.4%. Note that we have not yet tested the free version of the Opera VPN, which uses a different server infrastructure. ,You can see how Opera VPN Pro compares to the other VPNs we've tested in the chart below. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we now test VPNs throughout the year and publish the latest results in this chart.,In general, we don't believe you should select a VPN on Speedtest results alone. For one thing, cost and privacy protections are far more important. For another, network performance can be affected by time of day, local network conditions, and geographic location. ,Opera is clearly striving for simplicity with its VPN. Instead of building an entirely separate app, Opera bakes the VPN directly into its web browser. Opera VPN Pro is also affordable, and its free service—while limited to only protecting your browser data—is extremely convenient. ,A cheap, reliable VPN doesn't need a lot of extra features, and Opera VPN Pro lacks any additional features to speak of. However, even competing inexpensive services offer more for comparable monthly costs. The simplicity of a browser-based VPN also falls apart if you don't already use the Opera browser. And although Opera seems to do an admirable job of protecting your privacy, if you use more of Opera's services, more of your data may be gathered and potentially used to target ads. Moreover, Opera VPN does not support iOS, making it less desirable for anyone with an iPhone or iPad—which is a lot of people. ,As we said earlier, if you're in the market for a free VPN, you should take a look at ,, our overall Editors' Choice this year. If it's an easy-to-use app that still has plenty of extra features you're after, you should check out ,, another Editors' Choice winner.

Nokia 2780 Flip Review,"A solid voice phone that won't break the bank,I love portable technology—if you can put it in a pocket or a bag, I’m probably into it. I’ve covered phones and tablets of all shapes and sizes, and reviewed everything from game consoles to laptops in my decade-plus career. Prior to joining PCMag, I wrote articles for Android Authority, How-To Geek, MUO, New Atlas, Tom’s Hardware, and plenty of other tech publications.,The Nokia 2780 Flip is a voice-first phone that offers crystal-clear calls in a familiar clamshell design.,The number of simple voice phones on the market has thinned dramatically over the last decade, leaving those who need or prefer a basic phone with fewer and fewer options from which to choose. The Nokia 2780 Flip ($89.99), a handset that transports us back to the good old days of ,, is looking to meet that need. It features a familiar, pocketable clamshell design with large physical buttons, but disappointing talk times. While the 2780 Flip is priced well and sounds quite good for voice calls, the , ($195) offers better battery life and remains our Editors' Choice winner for feature phones.,The Nokia 2780 Flip takes the familiar design from the mid-aughts and brings it to the modern era. Available in blue or red with a black insert on the front, this attractive clamshell carries forward everything we remember from yesteryear with updated specs and performance. ,When closed, the phone measures 4.33 by 2.28 by 0.77 inches (HWD). When you flip it open, it stretches out to 7.96 by 2.28 by 0.45 inches. It weighs only 4.63 ounces, making it lightweight and comfortable to carry around. The rounded profile doesn't hurt.,The outer screen, which lets you see key information like the clock or the caller ID, measures 1.77 inches across with a resolution of 160 by 128 pixels. Incoming alerts feature colored graphics. The internal screen measures 2.7 inches with a 320-by-240-pixel resolution and full color. The screens are moderately bright, but sometimes glare obscures them.,Regarding controls, a volume rocker, power button, and , port are all on the phone's right edge. The left edge features a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the inside, you'll find six function buttons, including the send and end buttons, a direction pad, and a button on the top. These buttons are medium-sized but easy to use. There's also a full number pad with large buttons for dialing numbers or tapping out messages. ,The rear panel is removable so you can swap batteries if you want. The SIM card and microSD card slots are buried under the battery and require you to pull it out to change them.,The Nokia 2780 isn't rugged or waterproof. Nokia built it to meet an ,, but the phone isn't certified as such. I can say that I dropped it by accident a few times during testing and it took the falls like a champ. One time, I dropped it hard enough that the battery cover popped off and the battery flew across the room. When I put everything back together and turned the phone on and worked without issue.,While voice clarity may not be the top priority of smartphone buyers, with a voice-first phone like this, call quality is of utmost importance. Calls sound loud and clear on the Nokia 2780 Flip thanks to ,, which cleans up vocal performance. Add in the loud earpiece and speakerphone, which respectively peak at 70.5dB and 76.6dB, and you have an excellent phone for making calls.,Unfortunately, that LTE-enabled calling also leads us to one of the phone's most significant drawbacks: battery life. It features a relatively small 1,450mAh battery that provides only 3 hours and 20 minutes of talk time via LTE. Talk time would extend to about 7 hours if the phone is able to connect calls via 3G, but , in the US. Those who use the phone outside the US where 3G networks are still available should see better battery life. US buyers, however, are stuck with the shorter, LTE-limited time. In comparison, the Sunbeam F1 lasts about 5 hours, 30 minutes. ,The Nokia 2780 Flip is fine for sending text and MMS messages, though you'll be composing them with the physical number pad. Also, you'll have to contend with poor group messaging support. Texts from groups are separated into individual messages, which can lead to poor communication with multiple people at once. This was an issue we faced on the Nokia ,, as well. WhatsApp, available from the KaiOS app store, may help circumvent this issue.,The phone includes Wi-Fi for watching videos (via the YouTube app), downloading apps, and other such tasks. It supports Wi-Fi calling, too, so you can make and receive calls over Wi-Fi if you live somewhere with spotty cellular service.,The Bluetooth 4.2 radio means you can pair your favorite set of wireless headphones. However, you won't be able to download Apple Music, Spotify, or any other major music streaming service. You can use the YouTube app to listen to music, though.,If you prefer to listen to music over FM, the phone includes an FM radio and app. However, you'll need to plug in a pair of wired headphones to pick up your local stations. Last, you can store music files on the microSD card and play them back via the basic music app.,KaiOS may be based on Linux, but it's not Android. Instead, it's a lightweight platform made by KaiOS Technologies specifically for 2G, 3G, and 4G feature phones. It's a decent enough operating system for a basic phone, though if you're used to a smartphone it'll feel a little sluggish. It has a simplified menu system that lets you sort through lists, launch apps, organize apps into folders, and so on.,There are a handful of preinstalled applications such as a to-do list, a calculator, and some basic games like Snake. KaiOS has a simple app store that lets you expand the phone's functionality, though its selection is lacking compared with modern smartphones. You won't find many of today's top mobile apps, but chances are you can access them via the built-in web browser. For example, neither Facebook nor Twitter appear in the KaiOS app store on the Nokia 2780, but both work in the browser.,Nokia included an accessibility mode that increases the font size across the phone while also boosting the maximum volume above the standard limit. A quick dial button can be enabled via the settings that will let you call any phone number by pressing the button on the side of the phone three times. Finally, there are more traditional accessibility features such as color inversion, captions, reading of text out loud, and hearing aid compatibility. ,Most people in the market for a voice-first phone probably won't care much about the OS as long as it makes calls and sends messages reliably. While it could be better, KaiOS doesn't get in the way of the user experience, which is all you need from a device like the Nokia 2780 Flip.,The Nokia 2780 Flip includes a 5MP camera with a flash, but you shouldn't rely on it to be your main camera. This simple shooter requires lots of light to take basic images that don't come close to looking as good as what you can get from even a ,. It can also record low-resolution (480p) video, but again, don't expect impressive footage. And if there's little light available, it's best not to bother.,Considering the phone costs less than $100, however, we don't expect much from the camera and you shouldn't either.,The Nokia 2780 Flip is a throwback in its purest form. It's not without flaws, but most of them aren't deal breakers. The limited amount of call time is the biggest detractor here. If you're in the market for a flip phone with solid durability, great accessibility features, and clear LTE calling, this is worth a look. The Sunbeam F1, however, remains our Editors' Choice for its superior battery life.,The Nokia 2780 Flip is a voice-first phone that offers crystal-clear calls in a familiar clamshell design.,Sign up for , newsletter to get our top mobile tech stories delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Review,"AMD's flagship red warrior rivals the RTX 4080 for a cool $200 less,For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming. I began working on computers owned by immediate family members and relatives when I was around 10 years old. I've always sought to learn as much as possible about anything PC, leading to a well-rounded grasp on all things tech today. In my role at PCMag, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to share what I know.,With its excellent performance and extremely competitive price, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX is late 2022's best graphics card option for around $1,000.,AMD has just launched the first two new entries in its cutting-edge Radeon 7000 series of ,, starting with the flagship $999 Radeon RX 7900 XTX. With this release, AMD is taking a notably different approach from how its main competitor, Nvidia, positioned its GeForce RTX 40-series cards launched in October 2022. Instead of shooting for the moon to release a GPU that vies for dominance as the single fastest card money can buy, AMD aims to win over gamers with a simply better value. Though the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX has its limitations, if you’ve been waiting for a powerful graphics card that can compete with the , at a more attractive price, this is the card for you. And for that, we give the Radeon RX 7900 XTX our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards.,The , and its launch counterpart, the Radeon RX 7900 XT, hold the distinction of not only being the first entries in AMD’s new Radeon 7000 series of graphics cards, but also being the first GPUs based on AMD’s RDNA 3 microarchitecture.,This new approach is unique in its use of ""chiplets."" We'll explain: Traditionally, processors and graphics cards have tended to be designed as single large chips, in what are typically referred to as ""monolithic"" designs. Chiplets are sort of the opposite, being multiple smaller chips packaged together as a single component. Monolithic chip designs tend to have an advantage when it comes to performance, but chiplets make up for this deficit in scalability and cost savings.,Chiplet designs have been around for decades, but recently there’s been an uptick in their use as they hold unique advantages to problems facing the tech industry today, particularly in manufacturing efficiency.,In RDNA 3 GPUs, AMD utilizes two separate types of chips to construct graphics cards. The larger of the two chips used is referred to by AMD as a Graphics Compute Die (GCD). The GCD contains most of the functional hardware, including the shader cores, TMUs, ROPs, ray-tracing cores, display controllers, and media engines. Most of the GPU’s cache, including the Infinity Cache and the memory controllers, are held separately in what AMD refers to as Memory Cache Dies (MCDs).,What cards we’ve seen so far rely on the use of a single GCD with multiple MCDs. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX has in total six of these MCDs, and each MCD contains two 32-bit memory controllers and 16MB of Infinity Cache, giving the card an aggregate total of 96MB of Infinity cache and a 384-bit memory interface. The MCDs then connect to the GCD using ultra-fast interconnects that can support up to 5.3TB/s of bandwidth.,By splitting these components up, AMD is able to utilize different fabrication processes for the different components. The GCD, which is the more important component of the two, is built on a 5nm TSMC process and measures 330mm2. The MCDs were built on a 6nm TSMC process and measure 37mm2 each, adding up to 222mm2 among all MCDs. In total, all MCDs and the GCD have a combined area of 552mm2 with an accumulative total of 57.7 billion transistors.,As noted above, monolithic chip designs tend to have a performance advantage over chiplets, but this advantage is near-impossible to quantify and may be razor-thin. What is readily observable, however, is that chiplets enable more resources to be pressed into a component while also helping to keep costs down. AMD pointed to this as a key reason why it is able to sell the Radeon RX 7900 XTX for under $1,000.,The Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s GCD contains within it 96 Compute Units (CUs) that have 64 Streaming Processors and four TMUs each for a grand total of 6,144 Streaming Processors and 384 TMUs. Each CU also has two new AI Accelerators, and AMD is continuing to add one Ray Accelerator to each CU, as well, giving the RX 7900 XTX 192 and 96 of these processing elements, respectively. AMD says that the Ray Accelerators have been reworked to improve their performance by up to 1.8x versus the last generation in select games.,Clock speeds have not increased much over the last generation, with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX sitting just slightly higher (around 200MHz) than a stock AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX has a base clock of 2,300MHz and a boost clock of 2,500MHz. Given the rather slim gains in clock speed, the performance gains we will see in benchmarks will come more from improvements in the architecture and the more substantial increase in core count.,AMD also significantly increased the number of ROPs, from 128 on the RX 6950 XT to 192 on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX also benefits from significantly increased memory capacity and bandwidth, as it ships with 24GB of GDDR6X that connects up over the aforementioned 384-bit memory interface.,There are a few more, lesser feature updates included on the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX that you may want to be aware of. First is AMD’s Radiance Display Engine technology, which supports dual-link bandwidth of up to 54Gbps over DisplayPort 2.1, which enables the card to support up to an 8K display at 165Hz or two 8K displays at 60Hz.,Second, AMD also updated its media engines to include support for AV1 encoding and decoding with support for up to two simultaneous 8K 60Hz encodes or decodes at a time. And last but not least, AMD has opted to include a USB Type-C port on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s rear I/O panel along with the usual HDMI port and two DisplayPort connections. This may be useful especially as USB Type-C becomes more common as a video connection.,The card we have in-house for testing makes use of AMD’s reference design for the Radeon RX 7900 XTX. The card measures 4.7 by 11.3 by 2.1 inches (HWD), which makes it relatively large yet also significantly smaller than Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4080 or GeForce RTX 4090. The card comes equipped with three fans for cooling, and it has two eight-pin PCI Express power connectors.,AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and all other cards listed below were tested on our updated 2022 GPU testbed that features an , processor operating at stock clock speeds running on an , motherboard. The processor is cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler, and the system is equipped with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM running at 5,600MHz.,The testbed is powered by a Corsair HX1500i 1,500W 80 Plus Platinum power supply to ensure ample power is available to all components. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro, which has been installed onto a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD.,The main competitor against the Radeon RX 7900 XTX at the moment is Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4080. The cards differ in numerous ways, but both are new cutting-edge graphics cards, and as you’ll see below they both often turn in similar performance numbers.,There are pros and cons to all of the cards in these charts, but it's key to keep price in mind while evaluating the cards against each other. In particular, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s MSRP of $999 gives it a price advantage over the $1,199 Nvidia RTX 4080, and this will help to put the performance numbers into perspective.,It’s also fascinating to note the performance difference between the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX and other AMD cards like the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and the last-gen ,. We won’t dwell on comparing these cards together below, as frankly the older AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT is simply left in the dust by its successors. As for comparisons between the two Radeon RX 7900 cards, we will devote more time to this in our upcoming review of the Radeon RX 7900 XT.,Synthetic test results always need to be considered carefully, as they do not always accurately reflect real-world performance. It might be best to think of synthetic test results as best-case scenarios for each card in their respective test areas, but even then driver performance and the inner workings of the card can result in significantly different results in games.,In 3DMark and Furmark, we see the Radeon RX 7900 XTX perform fairly well, but not well enough to catch up to its main competitor, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, except in the Time Spy Extreme test. This situation is reversed in Unigine’s Superposition tests with the RX 7900 XTX turning in better DirectX and OpenGL test scores. Luxmark, which tests GPGPU performance in particular, places the RTX 4080 way ahead of the RX 7900 XTX.,AMD worked to improve ray-tracing performance on Radeon 7000-series cards, and this is particularly evident when you compare its performance to last-generation cards like the RX 6800 XT. In the AAA game F1 22, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX holds between a 74% and 100% performance advantage over the Radeon RX 6800 XT. That’s an , improvement generation over generation. It's worth noting, though, that the Radeon RX 7900 XTX is technically a closer successor to the Radeon RX 6950 XT, which we didn’t have on hand to test.,Though the generational performance gains that AMD has achieved are huge, especially without increasing their price, it’s also noteworthy that ray-tracing is a bit of an Radeon 7000-series Achilles' heel. Saying that cards like the Radeon RX 7900 XTX perform poorly when ray-tracing is used would be an enormous overstatement and unjust, as the cards do perform quite well here. The problem AMD has here is that Nvidia’s new RTX 40-series cards simply do far better in this department.,In F1 22, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 outperforms the Radeon RX 7900 XTX by between 11% to 17% depending on the resolution. This situation is reversed when FSR and DLSS are enabled for their respective cards, giving the Radeon RX 7900 XTX between a 7% and 10% advantage over the RTX 4080.,Things look even worse for the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, but we have reason to believe that some amount of game or driver optimization is at fault here rather than the card. We aren't able to test the game with FSR on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX as the option remains grayed out and the feature cannot be activated, which suggests something isn't working quite right with this particular game. We would expect this to be resolved at some point after launch.,In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX more often than not holds a small lead over the RTX 4080. In some games, there is effectively no difference in performance between the two cards, which we are considering any difference of 3% or less. In none of these games does the RTX 4080 manage to lead the Radeon RX 7900 XTX by more than that amount.,The Radeon RX 7900 XTX for its part manages performance leads ranging from 5% to 12% in a few select tests. The best of these is in Far Cry 5 at 4K, where the Radeon RX 7900 XTX holds a 12% performance lead.,Legacy game tests are always somewhat of a mixed bag, as performance tends to land all over the place. We run these games more to see if they will work on the latest cards than to see really how fast they will work, but of course, we are interested in that too. This is another area in which Nvidia gains a slight advantage, as the company’s RTX 4080 manages to run these games faster on average.,We measure the power consumption of our GPU test with a Kill-A-Watt monitor to gain a rough idea of how power consumption varies from one card to the next. This is yet another area in which Nvidia performs better with its RTX 4080, consuming considerably less power in our Furmark test and a moderate amount less in Guardians of the Galaxy.,From a performance-per-watt standpoint, this serves as another plus for Nvidia, and temperatures might as well. In terms of operating temp, AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XTX runs cooler, but we should mention we hear its fans running loud and hard throughout all tests with the GeForce RTX 4080 being notably quieter.,Nvidia designed its GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition cards with large physical dimensions and huge heatsinks that help them to stay cool without the fans needing to run as hard as those on AMD’s card. But this again is a bit of a mixed point, as the enormous size makes it harder to fit in cases.,Taking all things together, we’re left with the conclusion that on performance alone, neither the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX nor the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 gains a decisive win. They are both highly competitive from a performance standpoint, and which will work better for you will likely depend on which games you intend to play.,When pricing is taken into consideration, however, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX becomes far more recommendable. If you can get similar performance to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 from the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, then why pay the extra $200 for the Nvidia card? Might as well buy the card that leaves you with (lots of) lunch money left over. ,Nvidia’s strongest win, by far, is in games that use ray-tracing, but games that lack ray-tracing are still far more common than those that have it. What’s more, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX may yet still come out ahead in games with ray-tracing support and FSR, just as we saw happen in F1 22.,No doubt about it: $999 is still a , to spend on a graphics card. But there’s also little question that you get overall better value and performance per dollar with AMD’s card than going for Nvidia’s RTX 4080. This makes the AMD card the clear winner for most buyers looking for a card for peak 4K play, or truly extreme esports frame rates at lower resolutions. And therefore it earns our Editors' Choice award for high-end gaming graphics cards.,With its excellent performance and extremely competitive price, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX is late 2022's best graphics card option for around $1,000.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO 3i Review,"All-in-one PC convenience on the cheap,I’m a Junior Analyst and ISF-certified TV calibrator focused on reviewing computer accessories, laptops, gaming monitors, and video games. I’ve been writing, playing, and complaining about games for as long as I remember, but it wasn’t until recently that I’ve been able to shout my opinions directly at a larger audience. My work has appeared on iMore, Windows Central, Android Central, and TWICE, and I have a diverse portfolio of editing work under my belt from my time spent at Scholastic and Oxford University Press. I also have a few book-author credits under my belt—I’ve contributed to the sci-fi anthology , and I’ve even written a Peppa Pig book.,An all-in-one PC option for budget-strapped buyers, Lenovo's IdeaCentre AIO 3i gets enough right to be tops in its low-cost class.,In today’s ever-changing climate of wildly fluctuating component costs, ,, or AIOs for short, remain as viable as ever. Built in the same vein as its line of laptops, Lenovo’s IdeaCentre AIO 3i (starts at $529; $599 as tested) is productivity-focused, with some handy inputs that even include a DVD drive, an addition long-lost in many devices today. A closer look under the hood reveals typical budget-machine trappings, like a low-end Pentium processor with integrated graphics, though that's intriguingly propped up by a cool 16GB of memory and a 1TB SSD, both nice adds in this price range. Lenovo offers a variety of configurations with variations on the theme (less memory, a hard drive instead of an SSD), but we like this one, and with the right parts mix, the IdeaCentre is a fine budget AIO if you're looking to affordably upgrade your home office, earning it our Editors' Choice award for budget AIOs.,Wrapped in all matte black plastic, the IdeaCentre AIO 3i is a compact machine, consisting of just a 22-inch display resting upon a small stand. The stand is even complete with an indent to keep your mouse, spare change, keys, or small office supplies out of the way. ,Simply put, the computer holds up a pretty decent display here, with surprisingly thin bezels on all sides that do a respectable job of maximizing your screen space. Neither swivel nor height adjustment is available here, but the monitor allows for a healthy tilt for vertical adjustments.,The lion’s share of the AIO’s ports is found on its backside. There, you’ll find four USB ports: two 2.0 ports and two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports (all Type-A), an Ethernet jack, a power connector, and an HDMI output. But that’s not all—at the top, you’ll find the webcam, which can be pulled in and out of the monitor housing like a cartridge on a ,. ,Further to the left, you’ll find the throwback DVD optical disc drive. A little lower, you’ll find a small rubber cover on the left corner that hides a 3.5mm port for headphones. Sure, a higher-resolution webcam, a Blu-ray drive, or even USB-C ports would’ve really sweetened the deal, but what’s here is quite acceptable on a budget AIO.,The 22-inch display is easy to handle, at just 22 pounds and 15.9 by 19.3 by 7.3 inches (HWD). It’s definitely heavier than our bigger-screen top AIO pick from a few years back, the ,, and as far as 22-inch AIOs go, it's also more than a few pounds heftier than the ,. Still, this Lenovo AIO is hardly unmanageable.,Our $599 review configuration comes complete with an Intel Pentium Gold 7505 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, as well as the DVD drive, ,, and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Lenovo flogs about 10 different configurations that range from as low as $529 to as high as $800. The top option includes a whopping 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD, but the processor and integrated graphics remain the same.,A quick word on the Pentium Gold processor: As far as CPUs are concerned, the Pentium series is close to the bottom rung of Intel's processors, down near the Intel Celeron chips (the very lowest-end) and AMD's Athlons. You can’t expect much from these parts (which we’ll get into in our benchmarking analysis), but paired with an SSD and a good amount of RAM, you can observe some improved performance, at least as productivity is involved. Don’t expect any advanced gaming or video editing from this machine, though. That's just not what it's built for.,Two downward-firing, 3-watt speakers provide decent sound without losing too much quality at higher levels. They’re loud, without the tinny screech or chassis-shaking feedback you might find in lower-end , or ,. The included keyboard and mouse work better than I expected, as well. ,The full-size ,is lightweight, with outward folding feet for some added grip and elevation, and the , is your basic compact two-clicker with a tiny scroll wheel in the center. Its plastic feet actually work well on multiple surfaces. The glide is much smoother than say, the recent , we recently reviewed.,As you may have already surmised, the benefit of an AIO over your typical desktop is the fact that the AIO comes with a monitor, and the IdeaCentre comes with a rather effective one for its price. Lenovo states that the full HD (1,920-by-1,080) anti-glare IPS display puts out 250 nits of brightness (a claim we’ll challenge in our benchmarking section below).,There are even touch-screen variants, for users who might prefer it. Without looking too deeply, however, it’s perfectly fine for YouTube videos and DVD movies. There are no display settings attached to the monitor, and there’s no HDMI in, so you can’t plug in a game console to play on this AIO.,In use, the extra RAM allows for multiple apps to run at once without much slowdown, and that’s likely all you might need: Spreadsheets, emails, and your Twitter (or , feed) are all easily managed.,While the screen space might be smaller than you'd get on a mainstream budget monitor (you can find perfectly fine 24-inch stand-alone panels for under $150), the compact nature of the AIO is perfect for tight spaces, cluttered apartments, and micro offices. Video and audio are also very reliable, and the number of ports is welcome. Overall, the IdeaCentre AIO 3i is a formidable value with its 16GB/1TB tandem of RAM and SSD —but what happens when you compare it with its contemporaries?,In Lenovo's own lineup of IdeaCentres, there are many budget options to choose from—so why an AIO and not a traditional tower desktop? Do you not want to worry about adding computer accessories, like a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse? Then the all-in-one option is for you (hence the name). Do you like the idea of swapping accessories, or even popping the desktop open to make upgrades? The way of the classic tower-style desktop is likely for you.,At any rate, to see how Lenovo’s IdeaCentre AIO 3i compares to other budget contenders, we stacked it up against both AIOs and a couple of low-cost mini PCs for a more complete picture of its place in the decision.,Further to the point, AIO releases are fairly few and far between, and our benchmark suite has changed fairly recently, so we just don’t have numbers to accurately compare with AIOs exclusively. All of the machines here are similarly priced and equipped with entry-level gear in the same ballpark as one another. Keep that in mind as we parse the details.,Our first two tests are arguably the most important: UL's PCMark 10 puts the CPU through its paces, simulating a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheeting, web browsing, and video conferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess the load time and throughput of a desktop’s storage.,To further stress the CPU, our next two benchmarks are Maxon's Cinebench R23, which uses the company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, and Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro, which simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning.,Finally, we run Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. ,The IdeaCentre holds its own here. It doesn’t quite reach the top of the scoreboard, but it doesn’t fall too far behind either, besting the , and the ,. In PCMark 10, a number between 4,000 and 5,000 is ideal and indicates excellent productivity in everyday apps, like Word and Excel. To this end, the IdeaCentre falls short, but not by much. The Full System Drive test score is less optimal, as the IdeaCentre only pulls a measly 444 points. The solid-state drive offers lots of capacity for a budget SSD, but it is clearly a slower variety.,Neither CPU benchmark proves to be a winner for the IdeaCentre here, as they both take advantage of the multiple cores of a CPU. The Intel Pentium Gold 7505 consists of a paltry two cores, so it simply cannot keep up with demanding content creation work. That said, neither can most budget machines and besides—if you were doing any of that work, you’d be better off with a Mac or a dedicated content-creation desktop anyway. This is also made evident by the IdeaCentre's PugetBench score. That's just not what a Pentium CPU is about. ,The IdeaCentre makes use of integrated Intel graphics, which have come a long way in recent years. Truth be told, the likelihood that you’ll be playing any graphically intensive games on the IdeaCentre is low, but thanks to , integration on Windows 11, it's never been easier to play on your computer. ,Not to be outdone, we run two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark: Night Raid (more modest, suitable for PCs with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs). We also run two OpenGL benchmarks from the cross-platform GFXBench, run offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions.,The IdeaCentre scores on par with typical UHD Graphics on both 3DMark tests. The AIO likely can handle some very low-end browser gaming and even streaming; just don’t expect anything like high frame rates in games that need real rendering. Unfortunately, we are unable to run the GFXBench tests on the computer (a conflict with the test, not any deficiency).,Finally, using a Datacolor SpyderX Elite calibration tool, we tested the display in its default picture mode with an SDR signal and came away fairly impressed with the results. The IdeaCentre delivers a peak brightness of 269 nits and a black level of 0.32, yielding a contrast ratio of 840:1—lower contrast means brighter or grayer blacks and a more washed-out picture. Overall, these results are better than some 1080p gaming monitors we’ve reviewed recently, including ViewSonic’s ,.,Switching to the SpyderX Elite color gamut testing, the IdeaCentre manages 96% coverage of the sRGB palette, 75% of Adobe RGB, and 76% of DCI-P3. Solid color range and accuracy, especially for a screen that’s probably an afterthought for most potential buyers.,This Lenovo IdeaCentre AIO does a lot right, delivering adequate performance for its price point as well as some nifty extras, like a webcam, disc drive, and four additional USB ports. While we’re perhaps more lenient about its shortcomings because of its price and our test model's generous amount of RAM and SSD, there’s definitely value here. In fact, some of its shortcomings can be circumvented with some external hardware.,Are there better AIOs? Of course; see the , for one big example. But if you’re looking to grab an affordable computer, peripherals included, for internet browsing, office work, and movie watching (perhaps straight from a DVD!), and are cool with the caveats of a budget machine, the IdeaCentre AIO 3i is worth shortlisting. That earns it our Editors' Choice award as the best all-in-one desktop for extremely tight budgets.,An all-in-one PC option for budget-strapped buyers, Lenovo's IdeaCentre AIO 3i gets enough right to be tops in its low-cost class.,Sign up for , to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.,This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.
